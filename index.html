    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of electronic credentials can be tracked to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or linking separate interactions, all without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Five Days Until the Apple Watch Series 11: All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>Apple's "Awe Dropping" event on September 9 will introduce the Apple Watch Series 11, which is not expected to have design changes but will feature internal updates. Rumored upgrades include a MediaTek modem supporting 5G RedCap, a new S11 chip (without speed improvements), and a new, limited blood pressure monitoring feature to detect hypertension. The device is set for pre-orders on September 12 and a launch on September 19, with potential unannounced features still anticipated.</h2>
