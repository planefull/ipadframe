    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism within their Magentic-UI agentic system designed to enable agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and carefully managing context to prevent overflow, significantly improving the reliability of agents on tasks lasting hours or days.</h2>
