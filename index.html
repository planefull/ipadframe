    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, such as information overload and inefficient reanalysis. They designed a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data from literature. This AI-enhanced approach aims to streamline complex data interpretation, improve diagnostic yield, and ultimately reduce the time it takes to diagnose rare genetic diseases, enhancing patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17e: All the Rumors So Far</h1>
    <h2>The iPhone 17e, a budget-friendly successor to the recently released iPhone 16e, is widely rumored to launch in early 2026, shifting Apple's entry-level iPhones to an annual update cycle. It is expected to feature the same powerful A19 chip as the iPhone 17, although it may reuse the iPhone 16e's OLED display panel to keep costs down. Furthermore, the iPhone 17e could adopt a Dynamic Island design, replacing the notch and offering a more modern aesthetic for this affordable device.</h2>
