    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases efficiently due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis. To address this, a collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI-based assistant to support these complex sensemaking tasks. This AI aims to streamline diagnostic workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data, ultimately increasing diagnosis rates and improving patient outcomes for rare diseases.</h2>
