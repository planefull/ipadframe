    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis, when using whole genome sequencing to diagnose rare diseases, leading to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, a collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models, powered by M5 chips, are nearing mass production and are expected to be released between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026 with no other major changes. Significant upgrades are anticipated in late 2026, including an OLED display, a touch screen, a thinner design, and M6 chips fabricated with a 2nm process. Additionally, these future models may feature cellular connectivity and a smaller display notch.</h2>
