    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research "Ideas" podcast discusses the Paraphrase Project, which exposed a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to demonstrate this risk and then created "patches" to enhance biosecurity screening tools, shared globally with DNA synthesis companies. This collaborative effort not only strengthened defenses against AI-enabled biological threats but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing, setting a precedent for managing information hazards in dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses with an in-lens display are rumored to feature two operating modes: a full visionOS experience when paired with a Mac, and a lighter, mobile-friendly interface with an iPhone. The first-generation glasses, expected to be announced in 2026 for a 2027 launch, will lack the in-lens display but will include speakers, cameras, voice control, and potential health features. These smart glasses, detailed by Mark Gurman, are designed to compete with products like Meta Ray-Bans.</h2>
