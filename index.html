    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," which allows various uses of a person's digital credentials to be associated and tracked. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses efficient zero-knowledge proofs to let users selectively share information without revealing underlying data or linking identifiers, and crucially, it works without requiring issuing organizations to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly discounted the MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, now offering it for $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, a sharp reduction from its regular $99 price. This reduced annual subscription includes access to every live and on-demand match, playoffs, and features like "MLS 360" and "Sunday Night Soccer." While monthly subscriptions remain unchanged, the discounted annual pass will automatically renew at the standard $99 price for the 2026 season unless canceled manually.</h2>
