    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address challenges faced by genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing. They co-designed a generative AI assistant to help synthesize vast amounts of genetic data, flag cases for reanalysis, and overcome information overload and collaboration difficulties. This AI-enhanced tool aims to streamline workflows, improve diagnostic yield, and reduce the time it takes to diagnose rare genetic diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2025 Product Roadmap: What's Still Coming</h1>
    <h2>Despite its major yearly events being concluded, Apple is expected to launch several new products before the end of 2025. These include a refreshed Apple TV with a faster A17 Pro chip, an M5 iPad Pro, an M5 Vision Pro, an updated HomePod mini, and AirTag 2 with enhanced tracking capabilities. While an M5 MacBook Pro is also anticipated, its launch timeline remains unclear, and Apple may announce these internal updates via press releases instead of a dedicated event.</h2>
