    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research and Twist Bioscience, developed a "red-teaming" approach to demonstrate this risk and subsequently created more robust screening patches. This work led to a strengthened global biosecurity framework, including a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible information sharing, to mitigate the dual-use challenges of AI in synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>According to Mark Gurman, Apple's future second-generation smart glasses with an in-lens display could operate in two modes depending on the connected device. They may run a full visionOS experience when paired with a Mac and a more lightweight, mobile-friendly interface when connected to an iPhone. Apple's first-generation smart glasses, expected for an announcement as early as 2026 and launch in 2027, will not feature an in-lens display but are anticipated to include speakers, cameras, voice control, and potential health features.</h2>
