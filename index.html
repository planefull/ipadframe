    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its recent paper on the occupational implications of generative AI, which studied how AI chatbots like Bing Copilot could be useful in different jobs. The original research found AI most applicable for knowledge work and communication tasks, such as writing and gathering information. However, this follow-up stresses that the study *did not* conclude or suggest that AI would lead to job elimination, highlighting its focus on AI as a tool to assist with subtasks and acknowledging the nuanced nature and limitations of the research.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, according to Mark Gurman. This case would protect the device's edges without adding significant thickness, similar to the rubber bumper cases previously offered for the iPhone 4. The company is also rumored to be planning an iPhone 17 Air battery case, with both accessories expected to launch alongside the new phone in September.</h2>
