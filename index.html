    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low diagnosis rates and lengthy processes for rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI assistant prototype through a comprehensive study. This AI tool is designed to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing complex gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnosis efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro is Vulnerable to Scratching, But Not Where You Might Think</h1>
    <h2>Early reports indicated the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air display models at Apple Stores were showing scratches around the MagSafe charger. However, a scratch test by YouTuber JerryRigEverything revealed that most of the iPhone 17 Pro's anodized aluminum body is highly durable and resistant to typical minor scratches. The actual vulnerable area identified by the test is the sharp, raised edges of the camera plateau, where the anodized coating is less adhered and scratches easily.</h2>
