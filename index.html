    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, addressed this by developing and implementing "patches" that significantly improved the resilience of biosecurity screening against these AI-generated threats. This collaborative effort established a cybersecurity-style incident response for AI-enabled biosecurity risks and introduced a novel, perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sharing sensitive research data responsibly.</h2>
