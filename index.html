    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the Microsoft Research Podcast episode on the Paraphrase Project, which investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design. Researchers discovered that open-source AI tools could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, allowing them to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, a vulnerability dubbed the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. In response, a cross-sector team developed and shared a more AI-resilient protein screening system globally, alongside pioneering a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of sensitive research data.</h2>

    <h1>M4 vs. M5 Chip Buyer's Guide: How Much Better Really Is M5?</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new M5 chip delivers significant performance upgrades over the M4, including up to 15% faster CPU, 30% faster graphics, and 27.5% higher unified memory bandwidth. It places a strong emphasis on AI-centric design, integrating Neural Accelerators into every GPU core and offering multi-fold speed-ups for AI-driven applications and complex rendering tasks. While the M5 provides a material and future-proof advantage for professionals and users with AI or GPU-intensive workloads, average users performing daily tasks are unlikely to notice a perceptible difference from M4-equipped devices.</h2>
