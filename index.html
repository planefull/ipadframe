    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image datasets due to limitations in temporal context and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system enables structured, iterative reasoning using modality-specific agents and tools, significantly improving performance on complex visual question-answering tasks for both video and image collections.</h2>
