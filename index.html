    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to overcome limitations of current AI models in analyzing long-form video and large image collections, which require temporal and cross-modal reasoning. Built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture, MMCTAgent uses modality-specific agents (ImageAgent, VideoAgent) and an iterative reasoning loop to plan, reflect, and refine answers. This approach, involving structured ingestion and tool-based reasoning, allows for scalable, explainable, and improved performance on complex multimodal tasks compared to single-pass inference models.</h2>
