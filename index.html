    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, struggling with information overload, inefficient collaboration, and prioritizing case reanalysis, which leads to low diagnosis rates. To address this, a collaborative study co-designed a generative AI assistant prototype to support these professionals in "sensemaking" tasks. This AI-enhanced tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>10+ Hidden Features in iOS 26</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 introduces over 200 changes, including a Liquid Glass design overhaul and numerous less-advertised features that enhance user experience. These "hidden" updates include the ability to selectively copy parts of text messages, save recipes to Reminders with Apple Intelligence, and easily set custom ringtones from the Files app. Additional improvements offer better panorama photography, specific video frame search in Photos, the option to match home screen icons to an iPhone case, and new call reminder functionalities.</h2>
