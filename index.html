    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and user profiles built. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process (prepare/show) to enable users to selectively disclose information and prevent tracking without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>
