    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, making them more proactive, efficient, and capable of handling real-world monitoring needs.</h2>
