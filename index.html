    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in connected LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers from its extensive and complex product documentation to professional users. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This implementation led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for industrial applications.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods 4 Drop to $89.99 Record Low Price on Amazon</h1>
    <h2>Apple's base model AirPods 4 are currently on Amazon for a record-low price of $89.99, reduced from $129.00. This deal matches the lowest price ever tracked for the AirPods 4 without Active Noise Cancellation. While the ANC version is also discounted to $149.99, the article recommends waiting for a more substantial price drop on that model.</h2>
