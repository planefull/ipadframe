    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis, when interpreting whole genome sequencing data for rare disease diagnoses. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored designing a generative AI assistant to address these obstacles. This AI assistant would streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to increase diagnostic yields and shorten diagnosis times for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air: Release Date, Features, and Performance Predictions</h1>
    <h2>The article predicts the M5 MacBook Air will be released in March 2026, maintaining its current design and a starting price of $999. It is expected to feature a 3nm M5 chip, delivering a 12-15% CPU and up to 36% GPU performance increase over the M4, alongside better efficiency and battery life. While no significant design changes or OLED displays are anticipated, subtle improvements like an upgraded webcam or Wi-Fi 7 are possible.</h2>
