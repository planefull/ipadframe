    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, revealed that AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, identifying a "zero-day" vulnerability in AI-powered protein design. This discovery prompted a cross-sector "red-teaming" effort to develop and globally share a more robust protein screening system, effectively patching the biosecurity gap. The project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research details, setting a new standard for managing information hazards in dual-use technology studies.</h2>
