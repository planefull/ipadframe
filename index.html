    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, faced challenges providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse documentation within their knowledge management system. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, integrating PIKE-RAG technology, which processes multimodal content, creates end-to-end knowledge loops, and performs multi-hop reasoning for complex queries. This implementation led to a significant 12% improvement in answer accuracy, demonstrating PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial scenarios beyond lighting, like manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods 4 Drop to $89.99 Record Low Price on Amazon</h1>
    <h2>Apple's AirPods 4 (base model) are currently on sale for a record-low price of $89.99 on Amazon, a significant drop from their original $129.00. This deal applies to the model without Active Noise Cancellation and includes free delivery options, with faster shipping for Prime members. While the ANC version is also discounted to $149.99, the article recommends waiting for a steeper discount on that specific model, positioning these as early Black Friday offers.</h2>
