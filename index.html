    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form video and large image collections, requiring capabilities beyond basic object recognition like temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an open-source framework built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system employs modality-specific agents and tool-based reasoning to analyze complex queries across diverse visual data, enhancing accuracy and providing explainable, scalable insights for structured self-evaluation.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly preparing for CEO Tim Cook to step down as early as next year, with the company's board intensifying preparations for a leadership transition. While no final decisions have been made and the timing could change, John Ternus, Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, is widely considered a potential successor. This anticipated change is not linked to Apple's current strong financial performance, which includes record revenues and a near all-time high stock price, though Bloomberg's Mark Gurman disputes the immediacy of such a move.</h2>
