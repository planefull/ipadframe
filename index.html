    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Large Language Model (LLM) agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and preventing context overflow. Integrated into Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are reporting a persistent static-like sound when Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive, or Transparency modes are active. Users describe this noise as a hiss, white noise, or an ocean-like sound, which can be more noticeable in one ear or amplify higher frequencies. While Apple is reportedly exchanging affected units, some users find the issue persists with replacements, and the exact cause (hardware or software) is currently unknown.</h2>
