    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The research identified key challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis, including information overload, difficulties in collaborative sharing, and prioritizing case reanalysis. To address these, they co-designed an AI assistant prototype focused on flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and aggregating/synthesizing complex genetic information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Wallet's New Boarding Passes Now Supported by United Airlines</h1>
    <h2>United Airlines has become the first carrier to adopt Apple Wallet's enhanced boarding pass features, introduced with iOS 26. These new capabilities include Live Activities for flight tracking on the Lock Screen, airport terminal maps, and Find My integration for luggage, though Live Activities require manual activation. Several other major airlines, such as Air Canada, American Airlines, and Delta, are also slated to support these updated boarding passes.</h2>
