    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex tasks involving long-form video and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent using a Planner–Critic architecture built on AutoGen. This framework enables structured, iterative reasoning across various modalities, significantly improving performance on benchmarks by selecting appropriate tools and refining conclusions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Announces Launch of U.S. Passport Feature in iPhone's Wallet App</h1>
    <h2>Apple has introduced a new Digital ID feature in the Wallet app, enabling iPhone and Apple Watch users to create a digital version of their U.S. passport for convenient identity verification. Users can set up their Digital ID by scanning their physical passport, reading its embedded chip, and completing biometric verification steps on their device. This digital credential is currently accepted at over 250 U.S. airport TSA checkpoints for domestic travel, though it cannot replace a physical passport for international travel.</h2>
