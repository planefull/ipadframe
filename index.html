    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple to Donate Towards Hurricane Melissa Relief Efforts</h1>
    <h2>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced via social media that the company will make an undisclosed donation to support Hurricane Melissa relief efforts. Cook stated that Apple's "hearts go out to all of those impacted by the destruction" and that the donation would aid "relief efforts on the ground." This comes as Hurricane Melissa has caused catastrophic damage, flooding, and loss of life in several Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti.</h2>
