    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they cannot efficiently wait or manage context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and carefully managing context. This approach significantly improves agent reliability and resource efficiency for tasks like tracking emails, price drops, or repository updates, paving the way for more proactive and practical AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>OpenAI Acquires Apple Shortcuts Creators to Bring Deep Mac Integration to ChatGPT</h1>
    <h2>OpenAI has acquired Software Applications Incorporated and its AI app, Sky, a Mac-based natural language AI assistant. Sky was created by a team of former Apple employees, including Ari Weinstein and Conrad Kramer, known for developing the Workflow app which later became Apple's Shortcuts feature. OpenAI intends to integrate Sky's deep macOS capabilities into ChatGPT, with the entire Sky team, including the ex-Apple developers, joining the company.</h2>
