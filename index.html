    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling a "society of tools" and agents through horizontal integration, moving beyond the vertically integrated systems previously common in AI development. However, this growth introduces "tool-space interference," where diverse tools hinder effectiveness due to issues like excessive tool counts, lengthy responses, complex parameters, and naming collisions. To address these challenges, the article recommends formal namespaces, enhanced protocol support for client-provided resources, better server documentation, and client-side optimizations to foster interoperability and scalability in the evolving AI agent ecosystem.</h2>
