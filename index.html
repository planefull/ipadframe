    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, limited by context and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning across diverse visual data. This agent-based framework, with specialized tools for images and videos, significantly enhances model performance by providing capabilities like temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and self-evaluation, making it adaptable and extensible for real-world applications.</h2>
