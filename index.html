    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the vast and complex data involved in whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant aimed at improving "sensemaking" by synthesizing biomedical data and supporting tasks like flagging cases for reanalysis. This AI-enhanced approach seeks to increase diagnostic yield, shorten the time to diagnosis, and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with rare genetic conditions.</h2>
