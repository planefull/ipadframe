    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient technical answers due to its vast and complex product documentation. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling the system to understand multimodal content, utilize an end-to-end knowledge loop, and perform multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries, proving its value across various industries.</h2>

    <h1>No Ad Tier for Apple TV 'At This Time,' According to Eddy Cue</h1>
    <h2>Apple's head of services, Eddy Cue, has stated that Apple TV currently has no plans to launch an ad-supported streaming tier, though he didn't rule it out entirely for the future. Cue believes an ad-free experience is better for consumers if the company can maintain aggressive pricing. This position is held despite the service's price rising significantly since its 2019 launch, and competitors like Disney+ and Netflix successfully offering cheaper ad-supported tiers alongside their premium options.</h2>
