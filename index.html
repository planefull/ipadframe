    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email response or a price drop, because they lack the ability to efficiently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a new mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system. SentinelStep enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and saving agent state to prevent context overflow, significantly improving task reliability for longer durations.</h2>
