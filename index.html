    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to address the limitations of current AI models in reasoning over long-form video and large image collections. Built on a Planner–Critic architecture using AutoGen, MMCTAgent performs iterative, tool-based reasoning for multimodal question-answering, unlike traditional one-shot inference models. This system, with specialized VideoAgent and ImageAgent components, significantly enhances accuracy and provides explainable, extensible, and scalable analysis across complex visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>According to the Financial Times, Apple is reportedly preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO as soon as next year, with the company's board intensifying preparations for a leadership transition. John Ternus, Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, is widely viewed as the most likely successor, with an announcement potentially made early next year for a smooth handover. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman disputes the immediacy of these claims, and the succession plans are unrelated to Apple's current record-breaking financial performance.</h2>
