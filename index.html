    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases efficiently due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, resulting in lengthy processes and low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed an AI-based assistant through a comprehensive study, exploring how generative AI can enhance "sensemaking" tasks. This AI assistant is designed to streamline data synthesis, improve collaborative sharing, and prioritize cases for reanalysis, ultimately aiming to increase diagnostic yield and reduce the time patients suffer with unknown rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models are nearing mass production, with an anticipated release between late 2025 and Q1 2026, featuring M5 series chips but no major design overhauls. While these initial models might include cellular connectivity and a smaller display notch, more significant changes are expected later. Substantial upgrades, such as an OLED display, touch screen, a thinner design, and M6 chips, are predicted for MacBook Pro models arriving in late 2026.</h2>
