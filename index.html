    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to enhance the complex sensemaking tasks involved in genetic analysis. This AI system aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing vast amounts of scientific literature on genes and variants, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
