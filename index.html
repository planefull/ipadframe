    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing various uses of a credential to be connected and user profiles built. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary details or linking separate interactions, integrating with existing systems without requiring infrastructure changes.</h2>
