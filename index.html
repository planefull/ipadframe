    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and associated with individuals. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prevent their separate digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring existing credential issuance systems to be updated.</h2>
