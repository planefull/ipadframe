    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check conditions, leading to inefficient resource use or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism within their Magentic-UI prototype that enables agents to perform sustained monitoring by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow. Initial evaluations using a new synthetic benchmark, SentinelBench, show that SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more practical and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
