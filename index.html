    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex tasks involving long-form videos and vast image libraries, as they lack the ability for temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system that uses a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This agent includes specialized tools for analyzing long-form videos (VideoAgent) through a two-phase ingestion and reasoning process, and for static images (ImageAgent), significantly enhancing performance and explainability in complex visual understanding tasks.</h2>
