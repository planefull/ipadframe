    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis, leading to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated to design and study a generative AI-based assistant aimed at enhancing the sensemaking process for these experts. This AI tool seeks to streamline workflows by synthesizing vast amounts of biomedical data and flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes for rare genetic conditions.</h2>
