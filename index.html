    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient assistants.</h2>

    <h1>6 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 26.1</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.1, a significant point update expected around November 3-4, which introduces at least six notable changes and improvements. Key enhancements include new customization options for the Liquid Glass interface, the ability to disable the Lock Screen's swipe-to-camera gesture, and a redesigned slide-to-stop alarm dismissal. The update also adds more control over local capture recordings, a swipe-to-change-songs gesture in Apple Music, and a new feature for automatically installing security updates silently in the background.</h2>
