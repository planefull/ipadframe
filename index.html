    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute conducted a study on integrating generative AI to help genetic professionals diagnose rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. Genetic professionals currently face significant challenges, including information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis, which results in low initial diagnosis rates and extended waits for patients. The proposed AI-based assistant aims to streamline these complex sensemaking tasks by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating gene and variant information to boost diagnostic yield and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>Some iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone Air Users Experiencing Intermittent Wi-Fi Issue</h1>
    <h2>Early adopters of Apple's new iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and iPhone Air models are reporting intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity issues, causing periodic disconnections, especially upon unlocking the device, and impacting features like CarPlay. This problem, which has garnered numerous complaints across forums, appears to be related to Apple's new custom-designed N1 chip for wireless networking. While the exact cause is unclear, it is suspected to be a software issue that Apple might address in an upcoming iOS update.</h2>
