    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A collaborative team developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to generate these "paraphrased" toxic sequences and subsequently created and implemented "patches" to strengthen these screening tools. This effort resulted in a more robust, AI-resilient biosecurity framework and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing in dual-use research, as detailed in their *Science* publication.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, with availability slated for October 22, coinciding with the launch of the new Vision Pro featuring the M5 chip. This accessory, exclusively for Apple Developer Program members, provides a USB-C connection between the Vision Pro and a Mac for app development and diagnostic purposes. While details on new features, pricing, or compatibility with the original Vision Pro remain unknown, the current strap is noted for its USB 2.0 speed limitations.</h2>
