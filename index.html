    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a critical biosecurity vulnerability: AI tools can redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, in ways that evade existing DNA synthesis screening systems. A cross-sector team responded with a cybersecurity-style "CERT" approach, developing and implementing "patches" to create more AI-resilient screening solutions, which were then shared globally with synthesis companies. This collaborative effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research data and methods, establishing a new model for managing information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is expected to introduce a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, that promises advanced capabilities such as on-screen awareness and personal context. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers have "concerns" regarding the overhauled Siri's performance. Apple has a few months before the anticipated March/April release to address these issues, though lingering problems could lead to further delays.</h2>
