    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" investigated a "zero day" vulnerability in biosecurity, demonstrating how AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences to bypass existing screening systems. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, developed and implemented robust "patches" for these screening systems, which were then shared globally. The project also pioneered a novel approach to managing information hazards in dual-use research, balancing transparency for scientific advancement with minimizing misuse risks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV+ Teases Mysterious New Show From 'Breaking Bad' Creator</h1>
    <h2>Apple has shared a teaser for "Pluribus," an upcoming sci-fi drama series from "Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, starring Emmy-nominated actress Rhea Seehorn. Described as "genre-bending," the show's premise involves "the most miserable person on Earth" needing to save the world from happiness, with the teaser highlighting Seehorn's character, Carol, as being "different." The first two episodes of the nine-episode first season will premiere on Apple TV+ on November 7, with weekly releases thereafter, and a second season has already been ordered.</h2>
