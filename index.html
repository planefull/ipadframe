    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, failing to efficiently watch for updates like email responses or price drops because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into Magentic-UI that enables agents to perform patient, long-duration monitoring tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.1 Coming Next Week: All the New Features</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.1, the first major update to iOS 26, which is expected early next week with new features and interface changes, though it won't include the anticipated new Siri. Key updates include a Liquid Glass transparency toggle, an option to disable the Lock Screen Camera swipe, a "slide to stop" for alarms and timers, and expanded language support for Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation. The update also brings custom workout creation in the Fitness app, various UI tweaks across several apps, and for iPadOS 26.1, it reintroduces Slide Over multitasking.</h2>
