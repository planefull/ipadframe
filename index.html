    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified their recent paper on the occupational implications of generative AI, which studied where AI chatbots might be useful. The research found AI is most applicable for knowledge work and communication tasks like writing and information gathering, suggesting it can assist in specific subtasks within occupations. They explicitly stated that the study does not conclude jobs will be eliminated, but rather focuses on AI's potential as a tool to improve workflows, acknowledging the limitations of equating task applicability with overall job performance.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 'Liquid Silicone' iPhone 17 Case Colors Allegedly Revealed</h1>
    <h2>Leaker Majin Bu has shared alleged details and images of Apple's new "Liquid Silicone" cases designed for the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models. These cases reportedly feature a matte, soft-touch texture in eight distinct colors such as deep orange, grass green, and midnight black, and will include cutouts for attaching lanyards. While Bu has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, the accuracy of this information is expected to be confirmed when the new iPhone 17 models are unveiled soon.</h2>
