    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex reanalysis, in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI-based assistant to enhance their workflow. This AI assistant is designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to boost diagnostic yield, reduce diagnosis time, and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Teardown Reveals Apple's New Approach to Thermal Management and Repairs</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the iPhone 17 Pro reveals a new vapor chamber cooling system for the A19 Pro chip, significantly improving thermal management and preventing throttling compared to previous models. While the battery is now secured with screws in a metal tray, potentially simplifying future replacements, the device's overall repairability has decreased due to the loss of a dual-entry design, making many repairs more complex. Despite these challenges and a scratch-prone camera plateau, the iPhone 17 Pro earned a repairability score of 7 out of 10, partly attributed to Apple's provision of day-one repair manuals.</h2>
