    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulties prioritizing case reanalysis. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored and co-designed a generative AI assistant to address these obstacles. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>
