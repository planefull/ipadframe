    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiencies or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by using dynamic polling intervals and careful context management within a workflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, fostering the development of proactive and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>HBO Max Gets Another Price Increase</h1>
    <h2>HBO streaming prices are increasing for the third consecutive year, with monthly plans going up by $1 to $2 and corresponding yearly rates also rising across all tiers. These new prices are effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing users will see the hikes upon their next renewal. In addition to the price increase, HBO Max is also implementing a stricter crackdown on password sharing, requiring one-time codes for different locations and offering a paid option to add extra viewers.</h2>
