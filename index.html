    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, collaborated to develop and implement robust "patches" for these screening systems, sharing them globally to enhance biosecurity. This pioneering effort also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive research data, providing a model for responsible disclosure and proactive defense against dual-use dilemmas in emerging AI and biotechnology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV's 'Vibrant' Rebranding Starts to Appear in Latest iOS 26.1 Beta</h1>
    <h2>Apple has announced that its streaming service, Apple TV+, is being rebranded as simply "Apple TV," accompanied by a new "vibrant identity." Hints of this change, including new glass-like multicolor icons and visuals, are now visible in the latest iOS 26.1 and tvOS 26.1 betas. While the rebranding has appeared on press pages, it has not yet reached consumer-focused sites, and additional components to the rebrand may emerge soon.</h2>
