    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to complex technical questions due to vast, multimodal product documentation. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Azure. This specialized AI solution, capable of multimodal parsing and multi-hop reasoning, significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities for professional knowledge management across industries.</h2>

    <h1>B&H Lists HomePod Mini as Discontinued Amid Refresh Rumors</h1>
    <h2>Retailer B&H has listed all HomePod mini models as discontinued, with several other third-party retailers also showing low stock or backorders for the device. This widespread stock depletion, despite Apple still selling them, fuels rumors of an imminent update to the HomePod mini. The rumored refresh is expected to include an upgraded S-series chip and new color options, potentially launching before the end of 2025.</h2>
