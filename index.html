    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast, complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively designed a generative AI assistant to support genetic professionals in their sensemaking tasks. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app on their iPhones and Apple Watches. This feature, launching imminently for a $5 fee, allows the digital ID to be used at select U.S. airports and for age verification in some retail and online scenarios. However, users should continue to carry their physical license as the digital version is not yet universally accepted.</h2>
