    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they cannot intelligently manage polling frequency or maintain context over extended periods. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, paving the way for more proactive, efficient, and practical AI assistants.</h2>
