    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data analysis, in diagnosing rare genetic diseases using whole genome sequencing, leading to delayed diagnoses and unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline these intensive sensemaking tasks. This AI tool helps professionals by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yield and patients' quality of life.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app on their iPhones and Apple Watches. This digital ID can be used at select U.S. airports and for age verification, though a physical license should still be carried as it's not universally accepted. North Dakota is among several states, including Arizona and California, to adopt this feature, with a $5 fee required to obtain a mobile driver's license.</h2>
