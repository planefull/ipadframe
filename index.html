    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast "Ideas" features the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI-powered protein design tools could be misused to create toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, identifying a critical "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team developed an AI "red-teaming pipeline" to generate thousands of reformulated toxic protein variants, demonstrating their ability to evade current defenses and leading to the creation of more robust screening patches. This collaborative effort not only strengthened biosecurity against AI-enabled threats but also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data sharing in scientific publications, offering a model for addressing dual-use dilemmas in emerging technologies.</h2>

    <h1>When Will Apple's Macs Get M5 Chips? 2025-2026 Launch Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next-generation M5 silicon chip is anticipated to debut in some new products, like the iPad Pro and potentially a 14-inch MacBook Pro, before the end of 2025. However, the majority of Mac refreshes, including the MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac mini, are projected to receive M5 chips in early 2026. More powerful Macs such as the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are expected to get M5 Max or Ultra chips later, likely in mid-to-late 2026.</h2>
