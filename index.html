    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track users across various digital interactions. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or linking separate activities, and it does so efficiently for mobile devices without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly discounted the MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, offering it for $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, a sharp drop from its original $99 price. This reduced rate covers all live and on-demand matches, playoffs, and exclusive features like "MLS 360" until the end of the current season. The annual subscription will automatically renew at the standard $99 price next year unless manually canceled before the 2026 season.</h2>
