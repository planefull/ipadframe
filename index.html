    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to address the limitations of current AI models in analyzing long-form video and large-scale image data. Built on AutoGen, this system uses a Planner–Critic architecture that enables iterative reasoning, tool-based operations, and self-evaluation to process complex multimodal queries. MMCTAgent significantly enhances performance on visual reasoning tasks by integrating specialized agents and tools for both video and static images, offering improved accuracy, explainability, and extensibility.</h2>
