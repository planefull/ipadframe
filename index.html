    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be associated with a single person for tracking. To combat this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing any underlying data or identifiers that could link different interactions, all without requiring changes to existing identity infrastructure.</h2>

    <h2>Aukey has unveiled the MagFusion Ark, a modular 6-in-1 wireless charger that is the first to support the faster Qi2.2 specification, allowing for charging speeds up to 25W. Its design includes a base for three devices and three detachable 6,700mAh power bank spheres, all supporting Qi2.2 speeds and featuring USB-C ports and active cooling. These spheres function as portable chargers when removed and magnetic stands, with the entire system set to launch in the first quarter of 2026, coinciding with iOS 26 and iPhone 17 models supporting Qi2.2.</h2>
