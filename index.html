    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast *Ideas* discusses the Paraphrase Project, which revealed that AI-powered protein design tools can "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, allowing them to evade current biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative team demonstrated this "zero-day" vulnerability and subsequently developed more robust screening methods, akin to cybersecurity patches, now shared globally to enhance biosecurity. Beyond technical fixes, the project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive dual-use research data and software, aiming to balance open science with mitigating potential misuse.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says 'Great Ideas Start on Mac' in Ad Voiced by Dr. Jane Goodall</h1>
    <h2>Apple has launched a new "Great ideas start on Mac" ad, featuring a voiceover by the late British ethologist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall. The campaign celebrates the origin of significant ideas, inventions, and stories, suggesting they all begin from a simple flicker on a screen or a blank canvas. Apple emphasizes that the ad salutes how something great is created out of nothing and the many world-changing ideas that have started on a Mac.</h2>
