    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed "Magentic Marketplace," an open-source simulation environment designed to study the complex dynamics of multi-agent AI markets and their societal implications. The platform allows researchers to explore scenarios where autonomous AI agents representing customers and businesses interact, helping to understand how these agentic economies might evolve. Initial experiments revealed that while agents can improve consumer welfare with good discovery tools, they also demonstrate vulnerabilities to manipulation, a "Paradox of Choice" when given too many options, and systemic biases that could create unfair market advantages, underscoring the need for careful market design.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2 Beta 1 for iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and Cellular M5 iPad Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing the first developer betas of iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 for the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and cellular M5 iPad Pro, preventing their installation. This move is likely due to an unidentified bug specific to these devices' new C1 or C1X custom cellular chips, with one analyst reporting an iPad Pro was forced into recovery mode after the update. Apple has now fully pulled these updates for the affected devices, and revised betas are expected once the issue is addressed.</h2>
