    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Autonomous AI agents are emerging to automate market interactions, promising faster and more transparent economies, but their societal implications are complex and uncertain. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Magentic Marketplace, an open-source simulation environment to study these multi-agent market dynamics at scale. Initial experiments revealed that while agents can enhance consumer welfare, they are also prone to vulnerabilities such as declining performance with too many options, susceptibility to manipulation tactics, and systemic biases that could create unfair market advantages.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2 Beta 1 for iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and Cellular M5 iPad Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing the first developer betas of iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 for the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and cellular M5 iPad Pro models. This action is likely due to a bug specifically affecting their custom C1 or C1X cellular chips, as evidenced by a user whose iPad Pro was forced into recovery mode by the update. As a result, these devices can no longer install the beta, and Apple is expected to release revised versions once the issue is resolved.</h2>
