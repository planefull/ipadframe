    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability over hours, allowing agents to act proactively without wasting resources, and is now open-sourced to advance the development of efficient, always-on assistants.</h2>
