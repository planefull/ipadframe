    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article details the "Paraphrase Project," which uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, IBBIS, and Twist Bioscience, collaboratively developed and implemented more robust protein screening systems to counter these AI-generated threats. This groundbreaking work, published in *Science*, not only strengthened global biosecurity but also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for responsibly sharing sensitive dual-use research data, highlighting the need for continuous vigilance and adaptive defenses against evolving AI capabilities.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Hits Back at EU Law in Court</h1>
    <h2>Apple has launched a broad legal challenge against the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU's General Court. The company argues the DMA unlawfully compels changes to the iPhone, App Store, and iMessage, claiming these obligations compromise user security, privacy, and property rights. Apple specifically contests mandated interoperability for its hardware, the App Store's designation as a covered service, and the procedural propriety of an iMessage inquiry, with the court's final ruling poised to determine the extent of the EU's power over Apple's ecosystem.</h2>
