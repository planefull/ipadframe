    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively studied and co-designed a generative AI assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>UK Government Issues New Order to Access iCloud User Data</h1>
    <h2>The UK government's Home Office has issued a new demand for Apple to create a way for officials to access encrypted iCloud backups of British citizens, citing the need to aid law enforcement in investigations like terrorism and child sexual abuse. This follows a previous, broader request that triggered a diplomatic clash and was partially withdrawn by the UK. Apple has previously resisted similar demands by withdrawing security features and filing legal objections, raising concerns about global user data security.</h2>
