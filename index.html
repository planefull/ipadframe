    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a significant risk. In response, a cross-sector team developed "red-teaming" approaches to identify these AI-generated threats and successfully implemented "patches" to strengthen protein screening capabilities globally. This collaborative effort established a new model for managing dual-use AI risks, including a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive information, highlighting the ongoing need for proactive, adaptive biosecurity measures.</h2>

    <h1>Here's the Latest on Apple Suing Jon Prosser Over iOS 26 Leaks</h1>
    <h2>Apple filed a lawsuit against Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti in July, alleging they stole trade secrets by breaking into a development iPhone to access and profit from details about iOS 26. Prosser then leaked specifics, such as the "Liquid Glass" design, on his YouTube channel months before Apple's official WWDC announcement. While Ramacciotti's deadline to respond was extended, Apple has requested a default judgment against Prosser for his failure to appear in the case.</h2>
