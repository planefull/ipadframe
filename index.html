    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to context limitations and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This agent allows for enhanced accuracy, explainability, and scalability in analyzing both long-form video content through its VideoAgent and static images via its ImageAgent, outperforming conventional models.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's License Feature Launching in One of Biggest U.S. States</h1>
    <h2>Apple Wallet allows residents in select U.S. states to add their driver's license or state ID to their iPhone and Apple Watch for convenient, contactless proof of identity or age. This feature will launch in Illinois starting November 19, 2025, supported at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway, and St. Louis' Lambert airports, alongside a new Mobile ID Verifier app for businesses. Currently, this digital ID capability is available in 13 states and Puerto Rico, requiring compatible iPhone or Apple Watch models running recent operating systems.</h2>
