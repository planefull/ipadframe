    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and time-consuming data synthesis, when diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI-based assistant to streamline the complex "sensemaking" tasks involved in genetic analysis. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnosis rates and reducing the time patients suffer with unknown rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>iPhones May Soon Work Better With Third-Party Smartwatches</h1>
    <h2>Apple may be developing new functionality within iOS 26.1, possibly including "Notification Forwarding" and an "AccessoryExtension framework," to improve how third-party smartwatches connect and operate with iPhones. This move is likely influenced by the European Union's Digital Markets Act and the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit, both of which criticize Apple for restricting third-party device capabilities. If implemented, this change could enable competing smartwatches to offer features currently reserved for Apple Watch, potentially on a global scale or initially just within the EU.</h2>
