    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficient polling or context overflow. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability over extended durations, laying the groundwork for more practical and proactive always-on AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>M6 MacBook Pro: Release Date, Pricing, and What to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing a completely redesigned MacBook Pro, expected to follow the upcoming M5 chip refresh which represents the final update to the current design. This next-generation model is rumored to feature M6 chips on a 2nm process, an OLED touchscreen display with a reinforced hinge, a thinner chassis, a punch-hole camera instead of a notch, and potentially 5G cellular connectivity. Anticipated in late 2026 or early 2027, these significantly overhauled MacBook Pros are also expected to come with a substantial price increase.</h2>
