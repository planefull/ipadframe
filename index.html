    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to wait and efficiently check for updates over extended periods without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for monitoring conditions over hours or days, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
