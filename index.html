    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring due to their inability to intelligently wait for conditions to change, either checking too often or giving up too soon. Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, designed to enable agents to patiently handle long-running monitoring tasks for hours or days. This is achieved through dynamic polling adjustments and careful context management, significantly improving the reliability of agents for extended durations, as validated by their new SentinelBench evaluation suite.</h2>
