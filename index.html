    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>This article clarifies a recent Microsoft Research paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," emphasizing that the study aimed to identify where AI chatbots could be useful in different occupations, not to predict job displacement. The research found AI most applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks like writing and information gathering, while having less direct relevance to physical tasks. The authors stress the study's methodological limitations, noting that job roles encompass more than just tasks and that their data from Bing Copilot usage does not support conclusions about jobs being replaced by AI.</h2>

    <h1>From iPhone 17 Air to iPhone 20: Apple's Redesign Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning a radical three-year iPhone design overhaul, culminating in a special "iPhone 20" for its 20th anniversary in 2027. This transformation begins in 2025 with the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, followed in 2026 by the debut of Apple's first foldable iPhone, featuring dual displays and a book-like design. The final 2027 design aims for an all-glass, wraparound display with no bezels, representing a completely seamless device.</h2>
