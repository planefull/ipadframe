    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis. A study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored these issues and designed a generative AI assistant to enhance the complex sensemaking process. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information.</h2>
