    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project identified a critical vulnerability where AI protein design tools could "paraphrase" toxic proteins, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, a problem described as a "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. To address this, a cross-sector team led by Microsoft developed and implemented robust "patches" for screening software, strengthening defenses against AI-generated threats. The project also introduced a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing, emphasizing the need for ongoing collaboration and proactive system-level solutions to manage the dual-use risks of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, with a hint on its website indicating availability starting October 22, the same day the M5 Vision Pro launches. The original Developer Strap, released in February 2024 for Apple Developer Program members, provides a USB-C connection for app development and diagnostic purposes. While specific new features, pricing, or compatibility with the original Vision Pro are currently unknown, the existing strap is limited to slower USB 2.0 speeds, suggesting potential improvements in a new version.</h2>
