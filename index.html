    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but present significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and user profiles built. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to let users selectively share information without revealing personal data or linking different interactions, and it works without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and Samsung Push Back Against Xiaomi's Bold India Ads</h1>
    <h2>Apple and Samsung have reportedly issued cease-and-desist notices and threatened legal action against Xiaomi in India for an ad campaign that directly compares and disparages their devices. Xiaomi's ads, appearing in print and social media, mock the camera quality and features of rivals' premium offerings, such as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while touting its own products as superior and more affordable. This strong response from Apple and Samsung underscores the intense competition in India's smartphone market, where these tech giants are determined to protect their brand reputation and market share.</h2>
