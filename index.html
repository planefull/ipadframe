    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively designed a generative AI assistant to streamline this process. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis.</h2>
