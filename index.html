    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email or a price drop, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow over hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are experiencing a persistent static-like, hissing, or ocean-like sound when Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive, or Transparency modes are active, particularly when no media is playing. Users describe the noise as louder in high frequencies, sometimes worse in one ear, and making low-level music listening difficult. While not all units are affected and replacements don't always resolve the issue, Apple is reportedly exchanging AirPods Pro 3 for users reporting this problem, which remains unclear whether it's a hardware or software defect.</h2>
