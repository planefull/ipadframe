    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by using dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, fostering the development of more proactive, efficient, and user-aligned AI assistants capable of anticipating and adapting to real-world needs.</h2>
