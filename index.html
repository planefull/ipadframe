    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image collections, due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), which utilizes a Planner–Critic architecture built on AutoGen for structured, iterative reasoning. This agent framework, with specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components, significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of base LLMs in tasks requiring deep multimodal understanding and critical thinking across diverse visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Google Launches More Intelligent Gemini 3 Model</h1>
    <h2>Google has launched Gemini 3 Pro, its newest and most intelligent AI model, which offers state-of-the-art reasoning and an improved ability to understand context and nuance. It is touted as the best model globally for multimodal understanding, outperforming its predecessor on all major AI benchmarks and designed to be a "true thought partner." Gemini 3 Pro is rolling out across Google platforms, including a more advanced "Deep Think" mode for Ultra subscribers and a redesigned Gemini app with enhanced features.</h2>
