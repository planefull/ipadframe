    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast episode discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which uncovered a critical vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, creating a "zero-day" threat. A cross-sector team then used these AI "red-teaming approaches" to develop and implement more robust screening solutions, akin to cybersecurity patches, for DNA synthesis companies worldwide. This effort established a new model for addressing dual-use AI risks, emphasizing the importance of proactive vulnerability testing, coordinated disclosure, and innovative approaches to responsible data sharing to ensure AI advancements are used for good.</h2>

    <h1>macOS 26.1 Beta Hints at Pro Display XDR 2 With Center Stage Camera</h1>
    <h2>The latest macOS 26.1 beta includes code strings hinting at a potential Pro Display XDR 2, suggesting Apple is developing a new version of its high-end external monitor. This updated display is expected to feature a built-in Center Stage camera, a significant upgrade as the current model lacks one despite its steep price. The integration of Center Stage and Desk View capabilities would bring advanced video call features to the professional display, addressing a long-standing omission.</h2>
