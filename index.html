    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" podcast discusses how AI-powered protein design presents a "dual use" dilemma, enabling both beneficial innovations and potential biosecurity threats by creating novel toxic protein sequences that can evade current screening systems. Researchers from Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS collaborated to demonstrate this vulnerability, successfully designing AI-rewritten toxic proteins that bypassed existing defenses. This effort led to the development and global implementation of more robust screening mechanisms, a cybersecurity-style response, and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research data to balance open science with mitigating information hazards.</h2>

    <h1>5+ New Features Your iPhone Will Get in iOS 26.1</h1>
    <h2>Apple is currently beta testing iOS 26.1, the first major update to iOS 26, which introduces various new features and interface changes, though it does not include the anticipated new Siri. Key updates include a "slide to stop" gesture for alarms, custom workout creation in the Fitness app, and expanded language support for Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation. Additionally, users will find numerous interface refinements across apps like Settings, Home Screen folders, Photos, and Safari, alongside the reintroduction of Slide Over and external microphone adjustments for iPadOS 26.1.</h2>
