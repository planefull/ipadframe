    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes, failing because they don't know *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or giving up. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context within a workflow. Integrated into their open-source Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability for longer durations, paving the way for more proactive and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
