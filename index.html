    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to wait efficiently without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days through dynamic polling and careful context management. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves reliability for extended tasks and is now open-sourced, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and always-on assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone XX? 6 Features Rumored for Apple's 20th Anniversary iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Apple's 20th-anniversary iPhone, anticipated in 2027, is rumored to feature a radical redesign with a bezel-free, all-glass aesthetic and a curved display wrapping around all four edges. This futuristic look would necessitate under-display Face ID and a front-facing camera, alongside advancements in OLED panel technology for improved brightness and thinness. The device is also expected to include significant internal upgrades such as a custom HDR camera sensor, Apple's own power-efficient modem chip, and a second-generation 2-nanometer A-series chip.</h2>
