    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient technical answers due to its vast product range and complex, multimodal documentation. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, integrating PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This specialized RAG system, capable of multimodal document parsing, domain-specific reasoning, and multi-hop inference, successfully boosted answer accuracy by 12% without customization and shows strong generalization capabilities for other industries.</h2>
