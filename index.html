    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and manage context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Integrated into their open-source Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
