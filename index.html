    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to their extensive and complex product documentation. To solve this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia, implementing the advanced PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by leveraging multimodal document parsing, reliable data sourcing, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating strong potential for other industrial applications.</h2>

    <h1>Happy 24th Anniversary, iPod</h1>
    <h2>The first-generation iPod launched on November 10, 2001, amidst numerous rumors that often misidentified its true nature as a digital music player. Despite initial criticisms regarding its price, design, and Mac-only compatibility, the device quickly became immensely popular, revolutionizing portable music and kicking off Apple's tradition of product launch lines. The iPod line was officially discontinued in 2022, but its "spirit" and innovative legacy continue to influence current Apple products like the iPhone and HomePod.</h2>
