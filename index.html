    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in accurately interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data for diagnosing rare genetic diseases, leading to low diagnosis rates and prolonged patient waits. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI-based assistant designed to streamline the complex sensemaking tasks involved. This AI assistant aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing critical gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>
