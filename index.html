    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the "Paraphrase Project," a collaborative effort that uncovered a critical vulnerability: open-source AI tools can redesign toxic protein sequences, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, a phenomenon described as the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. To address this, a cross-sector team developed more robust screening systems and "patches," which were shared globally to strengthen biosecurity. This project not only enhanced defenses against AI-powered biological threats but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data and software sharing to manage information hazards in dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>Everything New in iOS 26.1 Beta 2</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second beta of iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1 introduces several useful changes, including a new slide-to-stop gesture for alarms and timers, and an improved toggle for automatically downloading security improvements. iPhone users can now create custom workouts in the Fitness app, while iPadOS 26.1 reintroduces the Slide Over multitasking feature and adds external microphone input gain control. The update also refines the Liquid Glass design elements and features various UI tweaks, such as left-aligned text in Settings and Home Screen folders, and a new "Display Borders" accessibility option.</h2>
