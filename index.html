    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image libraries due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner-Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. This agent uses modality-specific tools for tasks like video ingestion and image analysis, significantly enhancing accuracy, explainability, and scalability for complex visual question-answering.</h2>
