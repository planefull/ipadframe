    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they cannot intelligently determine when to check, leading to either failure or excessive resource consumption. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, fostering the development of more practical and efficient AI assistants, and has been open-sourced.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>Sam Sung, an Apple retail employee, went viral in 2012 when his business card circulated online due to his name's similarity to competitor Samsung. Apple responded by pulling him from the sales floor, causing Sung significant stress and paranoia about losing his job. He eventually left Apple in 2013 and later changed his last name to Struan, wanting to move on from being an "internet joke" and avoid unwanted attention.</h2>
