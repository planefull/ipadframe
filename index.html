    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project addresses the dual-use challenge of AI-powered protein design, demonstrating how AI tools can redesign toxic proteins to bypass current biosecurity screening systems, posing a "zero-day" vulnerability. A collaborative, cross-sector team identified this risk and developed a more AI-resilient protein screening system, akin to a cybersecurity patch, which has been shared globally. Furthermore, the project pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing, setting a new standard for managing information hazards in the evolving field of AI and biosecurity.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Home Hub Could Cost $350</h1>
    <h2>Apple is set to launch a new home hub with an iPad-like 7-inch display and an indoor security camera in 2026, followed by a tabletop robot featuring a 9-inch screen and motorized arm in 2027. The home hub, designed for smart home control, video calls, and personalized user experiences, is projected to cost around $350, with the robot priced at several hundred dollars. These upcoming smart home devices will be manufactured in Vietnam by BYD, shifting production away from China, with the home hub's launch delayed until 2026 due to pending advancements in Siri.</h2>
