    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast *Ideas* features discussions on the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI-powered protein design tools could be misused to create toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers demonstrated this "zero-day" vulnerability by using open-source AI to "paraphrase" a toxic protein like ricin, making it undetectable by current methods. In response, a cross-sector team developed more robust screening solutions and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research details, aiming to enhance global biosecurity in the era of synthetic biology.</h2>
