    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project discovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, highlighting the dual-use challenge of emerging technologies. A collaborative cross-sector team developed a "red-teaming" pipeline to generate these evasive protein sequences and subsequently created "patches" to strengthen and make biosecurity screening more AI-resilient. This initiative not only enhanced protein screening but also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of sensitive research, offering a model for managing information hazards in other fields facing dual-use dilemmas.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses, equipped with an in-lens display, are rumored to feature two operating modes depending on the connected device. According to Mark Gurman, they could run a full version of visionOS when paired with a Mac and a more lightweight interface with an iPhone. The first-generation glasses, anticipated to launch in 2027 without an in-lens display, are expected to include cameras, speakers, voice control, and potential health features.</h2>
