    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is increasingly hindered by memory and network bottlenecks, stemming from a fundamental trade-off in existing copper and optical communication technologies regarding power efficiency, reliability, and reach. Microsoft Research has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology, that resolves this issue by adopting a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed channels utilizing microLEDs. This approach offers copper-like power efficiency and reliability over long distances (up to 50 meters), enabling substantial power savings, reduced failure rates, and the potential to rethink and unlock new, more scalable AI infrastructure designs.</h2>

    <h1>New Live Translation Feature Coming to AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new Live Translation feature, introduced with AirPods Pro 3, is expanding to older models including AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, requiring an iPhone 15 Pro or newer with iOS 26. This functionality enables hands-free, real-time translated conversations, either by displaying translations on an iPhone for non-AirPods users or by adjusting Active Noise Cancellation when both participants wear compatible AirPods. The feature launches with the iOS 26 update on September 15, initially supporting English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, with more languages planned.</h2>
