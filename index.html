    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked to create user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information without revealing identifiers that could link their interactions, and it integrates with existing systems without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Models Expected to Set New Battery Life Benchmark</h1>
    <h2>According to Mark Gurman, Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are anticipated to feature significant battery life improvements, addressing user demand for longer-lasting smartphones. These gains result from larger battery capacities, including a 4,252 mAh battery for the iPhone 17 Pro and a 5,088 mAh battery for the Pro Max, achieved by reclaiming internal space from the physical SIM tray. Combined with the power efficiency of the A19 Pro chip, these upgrades are expected to deliver hours of additional usage, with full details to be revealed at Apple's "Awe dropping" event today.</h2>
