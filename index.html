    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is a complex and data-intensive process, often hampered by information overload and difficulties in reanalyzing cases. Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated on a study to explore how generative AI could assist genetic professionals with these "sensemaking" tasks. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize crucial gene and variant data, aiming to streamline diagnoses and ultimately improve patient outcomes.</h2>
