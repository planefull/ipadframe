    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article highlights "tool-space interference" as a growing challenge within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, where numerous AI tools and agents are increasingly integrated horizontally. This interference manifests as issues like excessive tool counts, overly long tool responses, complex parameter schemas, naming collisions, and poor error messaging, all of which hinder agent performance and increase costs. To mitigate these problems, the authors recommend protocol enhancements like formal namespaces and client-provided resources, better documentation from server developers, client-side optimizations for tool selection and context management, and marketplace solutions for centralized compatibility.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store Near Sydney Permanently Closing Next Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's store at Westfield Hornsby in Sydney, Australia, is permanently closing on October 4, having operated since 2011. The closure stems from Apple's decision not to renew its lease and to consolidate operations as its nearby Chatswood Chase store reopens in October after extensive renovations and expansion. All affected Hornsby employees will be offered positions at the newly redesigned Chatswood Chase location, which will include new features like an Apple Pickup station.</h2>
