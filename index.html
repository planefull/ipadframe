    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases due to the overwhelming volume and complexity of whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address these challenges, Microsoft Research collaborated with Drexel University and the Broad Institute to design a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and shortening the time to diagnosis for patients with rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Watch and Mac Mini No Longer Advertised as 'Carbon Neutral'</h1>
    <h2>Apple has removed the "carbon neutral" label from product pages for the Apple Watch and Mac mini worldwide, including for new models like the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3. This change follows a German court ruling against Apple for "greenwashing" regarding its carbon neutrality claims, as well as an upcoming EU regulation banning such claims when tied to carbon offset projects. While Apple previously used clean electricity, recycled materials, reduced air shipments, and "high-quality carbon credits" to meet these standards, its future plans for using carbon credits are now unclear.</h2>
