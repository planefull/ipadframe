    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track a user's separate credential uses to build detailed profiles. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge SNARKs with an efficient two-stage proof generation process, enabling users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing private information or linking interactions, and works without requiring updates to credential issuers' systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple has appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court, arguing that the latest court order requiring zero fees for external App Store purchases and dictating link design is unconstitutional and an overreach. This stems from the ongoing Epic Games lawsuit, where Apple was initially ordered to allow external links, but its subsequent implementation with fees led the judge to issue a stricter, fee-free mandate. Apple contends the new injunction improperly expands beyond the original scope, denies it compensation for its intellectual property, and is too broad by applying to all developers when Epic Games is the sole plaintiff.</h2>
