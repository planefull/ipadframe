    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, like tracking emails or price changes, because they cannot intelligently wait and manage context over extended periods without giving up or overflowing their memory. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for hours or days. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, paving the way for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
