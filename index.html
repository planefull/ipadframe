    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, resulting in information overload and low initial diagnostic rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively designed a generative AI assistant prototype to support these professionals. This AI tool aims to streamline data synthesis, identify cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregate gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Challenges EU Digital Markets Act Over Feature Delays</h1>
    <h2>Apple is vehemently urging European regulators to scrap the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming it has created significant security vulnerabilities and a degraded user experience for EU users. The company states that mandatory third-party app stores expose users to malware and previously blocked content, while also enabling rival firms to demand sensitive iPhone data. Consequently, Apple has had to delay or postpone at least three key features, including iPhone Mirroring, AI-powered Live Translation, and specific Maps functionalities, due to privacy and engineering challenges imposed by the DMA.</h2>
