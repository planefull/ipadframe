    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but present significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be tracked and associated with individuals. To counter this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, all while not requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Kuo: AirPods Pro 3 Coming Soon, But Bigger Upgrade Arriving Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release AirPods Pro 3 in the second half of 2025, likely at the September iPhone 17 event, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. While Kuo did not detail features, reports suggest the AirPods Pro 3 will likely include heart rate monitoring, a smaller charging case, improved sound quality, and enhanced active noise cancellation. Furthermore, Kuo indicated a more significant hardware upgrade is planned for 2026, potentially featuring infrared cameras for advanced spatial audio with Vision Pro and in-air gesture control.</h2>
