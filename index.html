    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries due to limitations in temporal understanding, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an open-source framework built on AutoGen, featuring a Planner–Critic architecture. This system uses specialized agents and tools for both images and videos, enabling structured, iterative reasoning that significantly enhances base model performance and provides explainable and scalable solutions for complex visual question-answering.</h2>

    <h1>12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple's 2026 Budget Tablet</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release the 12th-generation iPad, its most affordable tablet, in spring 2026, though it's not expected to feature a major design overhaul. The main upgrades include an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence support and improved performance, along with an increase to 8GB RAM. Additionally, the new model is anticipated to incorporate Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and potentially an Apple-designed cellular modem, with pricing expected to remain at $349.</h2>
