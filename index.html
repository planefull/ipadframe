    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to information overload, complex data synthesis from whole genome sequencing, and difficulties prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to enhance sensemaking in genetic analysis. This AI aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>
