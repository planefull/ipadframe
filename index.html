    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Existing multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, due to limitations in context handling, temporal understanding, and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen's Planner–Critic architecture. This agent uses specialized tools and an iterative reasoning loop to process, analyze, and answer complex queries across vast visual datasets, significantly improving accuracy and providing explainable insights.</h2>

While no final decisions have been made, Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus is widely considered his most likely successor. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has pushed back on the report, stating that he does not believe anything is imminent.</h2>
