    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency and context overflow. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system. SentinelStep enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context, significantly improving task reliability over hours or days.</h2>

    <h1>M6 MacBook Pro: Release Date, Pricing, and What to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple recently refreshed the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M5 chip, and M5 Pro/Max models for current designs are expected in early 2026 as the final update before a major redesign. The upcoming MacBook Pro, anticipated in late 2026 or early 2027, will feature next-generation M6 chips, a thinner chassis, and an OLED touch screen display. This redesigned model is also rumored to include a punch-hole camera, 5G cellular connectivity, and a reinforced hinge, all leading to a significant price increase.</h2>
