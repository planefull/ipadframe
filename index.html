    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading lighting company, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex customer queries due to the vastness of product data and varied documentation formats. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system, built on Microsoft Azure. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by effectively parsing multimodal documents, using original data sources, and employing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex questions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, New York, will reopen on Friday, November 21, following extensive, year-long renovations. The updated store, originally opened in 2002, will showcase a modern design with more wood paneling, moving away from its previous stainless steel aesthetic. This renovation is part of a wider trend, as Apple is currently modernizing several other stores across the U.S. and internationally, while some have recently completed their upgrades.</h2>
