    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, including information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, leading to low diagnosis rates. A study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to address these issues by streamlining the complex sensemaking tasks involved. This AI tool aims to flag unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes for rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is withdrawing most of its claims against Apple regarding a 2021 email from CEO Tim Cook. Cook's email, sent after an internal meeting was leaked, warned employees about sharing confidential information, which the NLRB had previously alleged violated U.S. labor law by interfering with worker rights. The NLRB is now dropping allegations that Apple broke the law with its confidentiality rules and worker surveillance related to the email.</h2>
