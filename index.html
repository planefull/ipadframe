    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form videos and large image libraries, lacking the temporal reasoning and iterative refinement needed for real-world context. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system for structured reasoning over extensive visual data. MMCTAgent uses a Planner–Critic architecture with modality-specific agents and tool-based iterative reasoning, significantly improving performance, explainability, and adaptability for complex visual question-answering tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Questions Funding Behind UK iCloud Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple has challenged the funding behind a $4 billion UK class-action lawsuit alleging its iCloud storage practices unfairly lock in users and lead to higher costs. The tech giant raised concerns about the financial stability of the third-party funder, Litigation Capital Management (LCM), which recently suffered a severe share value decline, questioning its ability to cover Apple's legal costs if the lawsuit fails. This dispute unfolds as Apple faces increased antitrust scrutiny, and the tribunal's decision on the funding is pending.</h2>
