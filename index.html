    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The research addresses challenges like information overload and inefficient reanalysis in whole genome sequencing, which often leaves rare disease cases unsolved. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to streamline data synthesis, flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and facilitate expert collaboration, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yield and patient quality of life.</h2>

    <h1>8GB iPad Prototype from 2011 Reveals Apple's Scrapped Budget Model</h1>
    <h2>A rare prototype second-generation iPad with only 8GB of storage was recently revealed by AppleDemoYT, confirming that Apple tested a budget model with significantly less capacity. This device, manufactured in 2011 and running factory testing software, confirms long-standing rumors of a planned 8GB iPad that never made it to market. Apple likely decided against releasing it because 8GB was deemed insufficient for a tablet, similar to their decision to phase out 8GB iPhones around 2012.</h2>
