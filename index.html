    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form video and large image collections, due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system uses modality-specific agents with specialized tools and an iterative reasoning loop to provide explainable and scalable question-answering for both video and image data, significantly enhancing performance over conventional one-shot models.</h2>
