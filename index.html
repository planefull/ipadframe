    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent to overcome the limitations of current multimodal AI models in processing long-form video and large-scale image collections, which struggle with temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent utilizes a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized agents like ImageAgent and VideoAgent to enable structured, iterative, and tool-based reasoning. This approach significantly enhances accuracy, explainability, and scalability for complex visual question-answering across vast multimodal datasets, as demonstrated by improved performance on benchmark datasets.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>According to the *Financial Times*, Apple is intensifying preparations for CEO Tim Cook to step down from his role, possibly as soon as next year, though no final decisions have been made. Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, 50, is widely considered the most likely successor to Cook, who turned 65 this year. While *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman has pushed back on the immediacy of the report, these succession plans are not linked to Apple's current strong financial performance and near-record stock price.</h2>
