    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex, long-form visual data, lacking the temporal and iterative reasoning required for real-world analysis across extensive video and image libraries. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. MMCTAgent utilizes specialized agents like ImageAgent and VideoAgent with diverse tools to analyze complex queries, refine conclusions, and significantly improve accuracy on large-scale visual tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly preparing for CEO Tim Cook to step down "as soon as next year," with the company's board intensifying preparations for a smooth leadership transition, according to the Financial Times. John Ternus, Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, is widely considered the most likely successor for Cook, who turned 65 this year. While Bloomberg's Mark Gurman disputes the immediate imminence of the departure, the report notes that any succession plans are unrelated to Apple's current strong financial performance and stock price.</h2>
