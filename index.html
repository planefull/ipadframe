    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism within their Magentic-UI agentic system that enables agents to complete these tasks effectively. SentinelStep wraps the agent in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing it to reliably monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving success rates for longer-duration tasks.</h2>
