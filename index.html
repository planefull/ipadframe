    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a significant risk. In response, a cross-sector team developed and implemented "patches" that substantially strengthened these screening capabilities, detecting AI-generated threats more effectively. This collaborative effort not only created a more AI-resilient biosecurity framework but also established a novel model for responsible disclosure and managing information hazards in dual-use AI research.</h2>
