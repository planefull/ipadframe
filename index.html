    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. To address this, the team developed an AI red-teaming pipeline that generated thousands of "paraphrased" toxic protein variants, leading to the creation and global dissemination of "patches" that significantly strengthened biosecurity screening capabilities. This effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, demonstrating a new model for managing information hazards in dual-use scientific fields.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Lobbying India to Change Tax Law</h1>
    <h2>Apple is lobbying India to amend a decades-old tax law that could expose the company to billions of dollars in taxes on manufacturing equipment it owns in local iPhone factories. Current Indian law treats such ownership as creating a "business connection," making Apple's global iPhone profits taxable in India, unlike its operating model in China. Amending this provision is crucial for Apple's continued expansion in India, which is increasingly viewed as a critical secondary hub for diversifying its supply chain.</h2>
