    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," featured in a Microsoft Research podcast, addresses the dual-use challenge of AI-powered protein design, where tools capable of great good can also be misused to create novel biological threats. Researchers discovered that AI could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, allowing them to bypass current biosecurity screening systems, akin to a "zero day" vulnerability in cybersecurity. In response, a cross-sector team developed and implemented a more robust protein screening system and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research, ensuring enhanced biosecurity while advancing science.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26: See Your Full Call History With Any iPhone Contact</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 includes a hidden feature that allows users to view a detailed, potentially years-long call history with any specific contact on their iPhone. To access this, open the Phone app, find the contact in "Recents," tap their name or the "i" icon, and then select "Call History." This extended view provides a chronological record of all incoming, outgoing, and missed calls, including dates, times, and durations, proving useful for recalling past interactions or verifying call details.</h2>
