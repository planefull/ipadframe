    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has introduced RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that completely replaces traditional 3D rendering processes like ray tracing with machine learning. This transformer-based model is the first to learn a full graphics rendering pipeline, capable of handling arbitrary 3D scenes and global illumination using only ML, processing 3D geometry and material data directly. RenderFormer marks a significant step toward general-purpose neural rendering, offering a foundation for integrating graphics with broader AI systems such as video generation and robotics.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: What's Exclusive to Apple's Largest Flagship iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Initially, rumors suggested the iPhone 17 Pro Max would feature exclusive capabilities like an upgraded Telephoto camera, but both the Pro and Pro Max models share the same general feature set this year. The primary differences are size-dependent, with the Pro Max offering a larger 6.9-inch display, a longer battery life of up to 39 hours of video playback, and a new maximum storage option of 2TB. Consequently, choosing the smaller iPhone 17 Pro means missing out only on these advantages in display size, battery longevity, and higher storage capacity.</h2>
