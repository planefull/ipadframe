    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow tracking and profiling of users' separate credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to widely used digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information without revealing any underlying data that could link their interactions, and it works without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>
