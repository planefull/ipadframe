    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with analyzing long-form video and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen's multi-agent system. MMCTAgent uses a Planner-Critic architecture with specialized agents (ImageAgent and VideoAgent) to perform structured, iterative reasoning, tool-based analysis, and self-evaluation, significantly enhancing performance on complex visual understanding tasks.</h2>
