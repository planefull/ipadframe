    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like waiting for an email or price drop, failing because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for conditions. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into Magentic-UI that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring tasks, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants, and has been open-sourced on GitHub.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are reporting a persistent static-like sound, described as a hiss, white noise, or ocean-like noise, when Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive, or Transparency modes are active, especially when no media is playing. This issue affects some, but not all, units and can make listening to music at low volumes difficult, with some users experiencing it more intensely in one ear. While Apple has exchanged affected AirPods, the problem sometimes recurs, and it's currently unclear if the issue is hardware or software-related, with turning off ANC/Transparency being the only surefire way to eliminate the sound.</h2>
