    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. A Microsoft Research study, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, investigated how generative AI could assist in these complex sensemaking tasks. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
