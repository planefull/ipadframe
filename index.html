    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability over extended durations, laying the foundation for more proactive, efficient, and adaptable AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Scores Legal Victory as Judge Decertifies 2011 App Store Antitrust Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple scored a significant legal victory as a judge decertified a long-running 2011 antitrust class action lawsuit against the company. The lawsuit accused Apple of monopolizing the iPhone app ecosystem by restricting app downloads to its App Store, but it was decertified because the plaintiffs failed to prove class-wide harm with reliable expert testimony and data. This ruling means the case can no longer proceed as a class action, requiring any future claims to be filed individually, though the plaintiffs intend to appeal the decision.</h2>
