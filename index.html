    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Rare genetic disease diagnosis is challenging due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and long waits for patients. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively developed a generative AI-based assistant to streamline the "sensemaking" process for genetic professionals. This AI assistant is designed to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>

    <h1>New iPad Pro With M5 Chip Leaked in Unboxing Video</h1>
    <h2>An unboxing video from the Russian channel Wylsacom has reportedly leaked an unannounced 13-inch iPad Pro featuring an M5 chip. This model, with 256GB storage and a Space Black finish, appears to have 12GB of RAM—an increase from M4 versions—but no noticeable external design changes. Given the channel's history of accurate leaks, this is likely legitimate and suggests Apple may announce the M5 iPad Pro in October.</h2>
