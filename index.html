    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficient resource use or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism within their Magentic-UI agentic system that enables agents to perform these tasks by dynamically managing polling frequency and context. This approach significantly improves the reliability of agents for extended monitoring periods, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
