    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while offering convenience, pose privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow tracking of user activity across various applications and services. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this through zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose information and prevent their digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring changes to credential issuers' systems.</h2>
