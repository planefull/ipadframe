    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is highly challenging, requiring genetic professionals to sift through vast amounts of whole genome sequencing data, which often leads to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and delays in reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals in their complex sensemaking tasks. This AI assistant aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant data from literature, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air: Release Date, Features, and Performance Predictions</h1>
    <h2>Apple's M5 MacBook Air is anticipated to launch in March 2026, maintaining its $999 entry-level price and current design. It will feature a 3nm M5 chip, offering a modest 10-15% performance increase for the CPU and GPU compared to the M4, alongside improved efficiency for potentially longer battery life. While subtle upgrades like webcam improvements or new wireless connectivity are possible, the display technology and overall fanless aluminum unibody design are expected to remain the same.</h2>
