    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has introduced MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to address the limitations of current AI models in processing long-form video and large-scale image collections, which often require complex temporal reasoning and cross-modal grounding. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent uses a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent to perform iterative, tool-based reasoning, evaluating intermediate results and refining conclusions for improved accuracy and coherence. This framework significantly enhances base model performance by integrating perception tools and providing structured self-evaluation, offering a scalable and extensible solution for real-world multimodal reasoning challenges.</h2>
