    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a significant dual-use risk. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed more robust screening methods, shared with synthesis companies worldwide to strengthen defenses. This collaborative initiative not only enhanced AI-resilient biosecurity but also established a novel framework for responsible information sharing in dual-use research, setting a precedent for future challenges.</h2>
