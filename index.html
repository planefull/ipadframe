    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models often struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To overcome this, Microsoft Research introduced MMCTAgent, an open-source Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen. This framework uses a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components to enable iterative, tool-based reasoning, significantly improving accuracy and explainability for complex visual questions across vast datasets.</h2>
