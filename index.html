    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form video and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This system uses modality-specific agents and an iterative feedback loop, allowing it to select appropriate tools, evaluate intermediate results, and refine conclusions, leading to improved performance, explainability, and scalability in analyzing extensive visual data.</h2>

    <h1>What's New With Multitasking in iPadOS 26.2</h1>
    <h2>The third beta of iPadOS 26.2 brings significant updates to iPad multitasking, largely improving the functionality of Slide Over. This feature, which returned in iPadOS 26.1, now works more like its iPadOS 18 counterpart, alongside new options for replacing apps in tiled views. Users can drag and drop apps from sources like the Dock or App Library into various multitasking layouts, including tiled views or Slide Over, and even easily replace existing apps by dragging new ones over them.</h2>
