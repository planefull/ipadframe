    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data involved in whole genome sequencing, leading to high rates of unsolved cases and lengthy diagnostic processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore the design of a generative AI-based assistant. This AI assistant aims to streamline analysis by flagging unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic rates and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
