    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is bottlenecked by network and memory limitations arising from a fundamental trade-off in current copper and optical communication technologies regarding power, reliability, and reach. Microsoft has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology that resolves this by employing a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed channels powered by microLEDs. This approach simultaneously delivers low power, high reliability, and long reach (up to 50 meters), promising significant energy savings, reduced failure rates, and the ability to unlock new, more scalable AI infrastructure designs.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Final Cut Camera 2.0 to Support ProRes RAW and Genlock</h1>
    <h2>Apple has announced Final Cut Camera 2.0, introducing ProRes RAW recording and genlock sync support for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, making them the first smartphones with these high-end video capabilities. This update allows editors greater flexibility with unprocessed data and efficient storage, while genlock ensures perfect synchronization for multi-camera setups. Additional features include open gate recording, Apple Log 2 support, and expanded manual front camera controls, with the free update arriving later this month.</h2>
