    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The study identified challenges like information overload and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis, which hinder accurate interpretation of whole genome sequencing data. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 16 Pro Max 80% Charge Limit: One Year Later, Was It Worth It?</h1>
    <h2>The author conducted a one-year experiment limiting their iPhone 16 Pro Max's charge to 80% to assess its impact on battery longevity, a follow-up to a similar test on the iPhone 15. After a year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max's battery capacity was 94% with 299 charge cycles, a result comparable to the previous year's iPhone 15 test and even slightly lower than a coworker's phone without the limit. Ultimately, the author concluded that the 80% charge limit was not worth the inconvenience for a one-year period, finding the results disappointing in terms of battery health improvement.</h2>
