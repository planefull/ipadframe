    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, limited by short context windows and single-pass inference. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner-Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. MMCTAgent employs modality-specific agents and tools to analyze complex queries, improving accuracy and providing explainable, scalable insights across diverse visual data, as demonstrated by enhanced performance on various benchmarks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Watch Users Claim Workout App Is Now Worse in Every Way</h1>
    <h2>Apple Watch users are voicing widespread frustration with the redesigned Workout app introduced in watchOS 26, finding its new interface difficult and exasperating. The update replaced large, easily tapped workout tiles with a scrolling, corner-button system featuring smaller tap targets and animations before starting, which breaks years of user muscle memory. Consequently, many users report issues such as needing multiple taps to begin workouts, accidental starts, lag, and an inability to reliably initiate exercises, especially when wet or in motion.</h2>
