    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow various online activities to be tracked and associated with individuals. To counter this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent allows users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data, ensuring separate digital interactions remain unlinked and protecting privacy without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
