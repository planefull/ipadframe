    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare genetic diseases due to the vast, complex data from whole genome sequencing and the time-consuming process of reanalysis. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore how a generative AI assistant could streamline these complex sensemaking tasks. They co-designed a prototype AI tool intended to help synthesize biomedical data, flag cases for reanalysis based on new findings, and enhance collaboration among experts, ultimately aiming to improve diagnosis rates and patient outcomes.</h2>
