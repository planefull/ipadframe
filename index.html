    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management, allowing them to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into the Magentic-UI prototype and validated using the SentinelBench evaluation suite, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
