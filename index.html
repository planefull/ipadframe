    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like email tracking or price watching because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management to prevent overflow. Implemented in Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer monitoring durations, making agents more proactive, efficient, and capable of anticipating user needs.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>Sam Sung, an Apple retail employee, went viral in 2012 because his name was the same as Apple's main competitor, Samsung, leading to significant stress and paranoia about his job. Apple reacted by pulling him from the sales floor and confiscating his business cards as the "joke" spread online. After leaving Apple in 2013, Sung eventually changed his last name to Struan to avoid being known as an "internet joke," though he now wishes he hadn't stressed about it so much.</h2>
