    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world visual reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This system integrates modality-specific agents with specialized tools and a reflective loop, significantly improving performance on visual question-answering tasks and offering explainable, extensible, and scalable solutions for diverse applications.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Hit With $634 Million Verdict in Apple Watch Blood Oxygen Patent Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>A U.S. federal jury has ordered Apple to pay medical technology company Masimo $634 million for infringing patents related to the blood oxygen-sensing technology in the Apple Watch. Apple plans to appeal the verdict, arguing the patent is invalid and expired, while Masimo considers this a significant win for protecting its intellectual property. This patent dispute previously caused a U.S. sales ban on certain Apple Watch models, leading Apple to implement a software workaround that Masimo has since challenged with another lawsuit.</h2>
