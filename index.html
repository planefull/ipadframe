    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to overcome challenges in efficiently providing accurate answers from its vast, complex product documentation to professional users. They integrated PIKE-RAG technology, which excels at parsing multimodal documents, establishing an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning on intricate queries. This implementation significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% in Signify's knowledge management system and demonstrated PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for other industries.</h2>
