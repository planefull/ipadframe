    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, as existing models lack temporal understanding and iterative refinement capabilities. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This agent uses modality-specific tools and an iterative self-evaluation loop to provide accurate, explainable, and scalable insights across large visual datasets, significantly improving performance on benchmarks.</h2>
