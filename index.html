    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, discussed on the Microsoft Research Podcast, uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team then developed and deployed a cybersecurity-style response, successfully patching these vulnerabilities and creating a more AI-resilient screening solution. This effort not only strengthened global biosecurity against AI-enabled threats but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data sharing, setting a precedent for managing information hazards in dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>Samsung to Unveil Apple Vision Pro Competitor Tomorrow</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is holding a Galaxy Event tomorrow to unveil "Project Moohan," a new mixed reality headset designed to directly compete with the Apple Vision Pro. This "AI-native device" will run Android XR, an operating system co-created with Google and Qualcomm, and promises advanced AI features including Gemini integration, immersive virtual environments, and real-world passthrough. While details on weight and cost are unknown, the headset's design, featuring a ski-goggle-like display, fabric seal, adjustable strap, and external battery, closely resembles the Vision Pro.</h2>
