    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, a collaborative effort co-led by Microsoft, uncovered a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing DNA synthesis screening systems. This "zero day" discovery prompted a cybersecurity-style emergency response, leading to the development and implementation of more AI-resilient screening solutions now shared with gene synthesis companies worldwide. The project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, demonstrating a path for balancing open science with mitigating information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>What to Expect From Apple's New Products as Early as This Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to announce several new products "this week" through press releases, not a formal event, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Updates are anticipated for the iPad Pro, Vision Pro, and the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, with all three likely receiving Apple's next-generation M5 chip for performance boosts. The article also mentions potential upcoming updates for other products like the HomePod mini, Apple TV, and AirTag later this year.</h2>
