    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast *Ideas* discusses the Paraphrase Project, which explored how AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, revealing a "zero-day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team then developed and implemented more robust, AI-resilient protein screening solutions, which were shared globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium. The project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for sensitive data, balancing open science with mitigating information hazards, serving as a model for addressing dual-use dilemmas in emerging technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Vision Pro Future Uncertain as All Headset Development Is Seemingly Paused</h1>
    <h2>Apple has reportedly paused all active development on redesigned Vision Pro headsets, including both a planned cheaper "Vision Air" and a second-generation "Vision Pro 2." This strategic pivot is largely due to the original Vision Pro's high cost, bulk, and limited market appeal, prompting the company to redirect its focus towards smart glasses. While Apple plans a minor refresh of the existing Vision Pro with an M5 chip to sustain the product line, its long-term future as a headset platform remains uncertain.</h2>
