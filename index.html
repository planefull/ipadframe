    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could generate toxic proteins capable of evading existing screening systems, dubbed the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. A collaborative team from Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to demonstrate this risk and subsequently created "patches" to establish a more robust protein screening system, now shared globally. Beyond the technical solution, the project pioneered a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive research data, setting a precedent for responsible disclosure and emphasizing the ongoing need for layered defenses and international cooperation against the dual-use challenges of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Home Hub Could Cost $350</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to launch a new home hub and indoor security camera in 2026, followed by a tabletop robot in 2027. The home hub will feature a 7-inch iPad-like display for smart home control, a FaceTime camera, and person recognition, with a potential price point of around $350. These devices will be manufactured by BYD in Vietnam to reduce Apple's reliance on China, with the home hub's launch delayed until 2026 due to an advanced version of Siri not being ready.</h2>
