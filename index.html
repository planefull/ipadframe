    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to wasted resources or missed events. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation allows agents to reliably monitor conditions for hours or days by intelligently adjusting polling intervals and preventing context overflow, thereby enabling more practical and proactive agent applications.</h2>
