    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image libraries, requiring capabilities like temporal understanding and iterative refinement that current single-pass inference models lack. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner–Critic architecture. This agent uses modality-specific tools and an iterative reasoning loop to plan, reflect, and refine conclusions, significantly improving performance on benchmarks for long-form video and large-scale image analysis.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 16e Has Apparently 'Failed' Just Like iPhone Air</h1>
    <h2>Apple's entry-level iPhone 16e and the iPhone Air are reportedly experiencing very poor sales, with the 16e's attempt at a low-cost model deemed a "failure." Due to weak demand, iPhone Air production is expected to cease and its successor has been delayed, although Apple still plans future iterations for both models with anticipated enhancements. In contrast, demand for the standard iPhone 17 lineup continues to surge, leading to increased production orders.</h2>
