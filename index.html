    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but introduce privacy risks due to "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be associated with an individual, enabling tracking. To combat this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, and it integrates without requiring existing credential issuance systems to be updated.</h2>

    <h1>Rivian Activates Apple Car Key Support in Second-Generation Vehicles</h1>
    <h2>EV manufacturer Rivian has finally activated support for Apple's digital car keys through the Wallet app on iPhone and Apple Watch for its second-generation R1S and R1T vehicles, a feature announced over a year ago. This integration allows users to unlock their cars simply by holding their device near the NFC reader, offering more seamless features like key sharing and Express Mode compared to Rivian's existing digital key. While Rivian still has no plans for CarPlay support, this rollout joins Apple Music as another significant Apple feature adopted by the brand.</h2>
