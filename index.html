    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" investigated how advanced AI tools for protein design could be misused to create toxic proteins that bypass current biosecurity screening systems, identifying a critical "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team developed an AI-driven "red-teaming" pipeline to demonstrate this risk and subsequently created more robust "patched" screening solutions, which have since been shared with global synthesis companies. This effort also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for scientific peer review and data sharing, balancing open science with the need to responsibly manage information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Suppliers Already Preparing for iPhone 18's Camera</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is re-entering Apple's camera image sensor supply chain for the iPhone 18, ending Sony's near-monopoly and diversifying Apple's component sources. This shift is driving significant investment in the semiconductor supply chain, with testing partner Doosan Tesna spending $123 million on new equipment to support Samsung's new Austin, Texas production line. The move reflects Apple's strategy to reduce reliance on Japanese suppliers and expand U.S. production, potentially indicating a need for more advanced image sensor verification processes.</h2>
