    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast highlights the "Paraphrase Project," which discovered that AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to evade current biosecurity screening systems, creating a "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team proactively addressed this by developing and implementing more robust protein screening solutions, effectively patching this critical weakness. This effort also introduced a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for managing sensitive dual-use information, setting a precedent for handling AI risks in biotechnology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Modifies In-Store MagSafe Stands to Prevent iPhone 17 Marks</h1>
    <h2>Apple is adding protective silicone rings to its in-store MagSafe charging stands to prevent marks from appearing on iPhone 17 series displays and other models. This action follows reports of what appeared to be scratches, which Apple previously clarified were actually material transfer from worn chargers that could be cleaned. It remains unclear if this protective measure is a widespread global rollout or localized to specific regions.</h2>
