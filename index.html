    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases efficiently due to the overwhelming volume and complexity of whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates and laborious reanalysis processes. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed strategies for a generative AI-based assistant to address these challenges. This AI assistant is designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yield and shorten the time to diagnosis for patients with rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is accelerating the development of its first-generation smart glasses to compete with Meta, prioritizing them over the next Vision Pro model. These fashion-forward glasses will heavily rely on a rearchitected, intelligent Siri for voice-based controls and numerous AI features, including visual intelligence and language translation via integrated cameras, though they will require an iPhone for full functionality and won't feature a display. The smart glasses are anticipated to be announced in late 2026 or early 2027, offering capabilities like taking photos, recording video, playing audio, and providing directions.</h2>
