    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing various uses of a person's digital credentials to be tracked and profiled. To counter this, Microsoft Research has introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that brings "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices, to ensure users can selectively disclose necessary information without revealing identifiers or allowing separate digital interactions to be connected, all without requiring updates from credential-issuing organizations.</h2>

    <h1>One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>Apple will introduce the standard iPhone 17 next week as its most affordable option, which, despite being "least interesting" compared to the Air and Pro models, still offers several upgrades. It will feature an increased 6.3-inch display, potentially a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, a new A19 chip with vapor chamber cooling, and an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera. The iPhone 17 is expected to launch on September 19 with Wi-Fi 7 support and new color options, potentially seeing a price increase to around $850.</h2>
