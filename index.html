    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative, cross-sector team then developed and implemented a cybersecurity-style response, creating significantly more resilient protein screening tools and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific information. This initiative demonstrates a proactive model for addressing the dual-use challenges of AI in biology, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance, collaboration, and adaptive safeguards to mitigate potential catastrophic risks while harnessing AI's benefits.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is set to introduce a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, promising enhanced features like on-screen awareness and personal context. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers have "concerns" about the overhauled Siri's performance, though specific issues were not detailed. Apple has a few months before the expected March or April release to address these lingering problems, following previous delays for the new Siri features.</h2>
