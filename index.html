    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research *Ideas* podcast episode discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which uncovered a significant vulnerability: AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a "zero day" threat. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, addressed this by developing AI red-teaming approaches to test vulnerabilities, create more robust screening systems, and implement "patches" shared globally. This collaborative effort, detailed in *Science*, not only strengthened biosecurity against AI misuse but also pioneered a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for handling sensitive dual-use research data responsibly.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses, featuring an in-lens display, are rumored to offer two distinct operating modes depending on whether they are paired with an iPhone or a Mac. The first version of Apple's smart glasses, expected to launch in 2027, will not include an in-lens display but will offer speakers, cameras, voice control, and potential health features. These initial glasses, potentially announced in 2026, will compete with devices like Meta Ray-Bans.</h2>
