    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" by Microsoft Research uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences, making them undetectable by current biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed "patches" to strengthen these screening systems, demonstrating the need for continuous vigilance against AI's dual-use capabilities in biology. The project also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of sensitive research data, establishing a model for addressing information hazards in other fields facing dual-use dilemmas.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Home Hub Could Cost $350</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly preparing to launch a new home hub with a 7-inch display and an indoor security camera in 2026, followed by a tabletop robot in 2027. The home hub will feature app support, smart home control, FaceTime, and person recognition, with a projected price point of around $350 for wall-mounted and tabletop versions. These devices, whose launch was delayed due to Siri's development, are planned to be manufactured in Vietnam with BYD, diversifying Apple's production away from China.</h2>
