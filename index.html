    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing tracking of separate credential uses to build user profiles. To combat this, Microsoft Research introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or linking their various digital interactions, enhancing privacy without requiring major system overhauls.</h2>

    <h1>Court Allows Google-Apple Search Deal to Continue With Conditions</h1>
    <h2>A judge has ruled that Google can continue its search agreements and make payments to companies like Apple, despite the company being found to have a search monopoly. Google is allowed to pay for the preloading and placement of its search products, but is barred from entering into exclusive search engine distribution contracts. Additionally, Google will not be forced to sell Chrome or Android, though it must share data with rival search engines.</h2>
