    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The research identified key challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis, such as information overload, collaborative sharing inefficiencies, and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis. They co-designed a prototype AI assistant aimed at streamlining workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing vast amounts of genetic information, ultimately seeking to improve diagnostic rates and patient outcomes.</h2>
