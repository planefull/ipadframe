    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for specific emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that integrates dynamic polling and efficient context management into agent workflows. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and evaluated using a synthetic benchmark called SentinelBench, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability and success rates for tasks lasting several hours, paving the way for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Jon Prosser Provides Update on Apple Lawsuit Over iOS 26 Leaks</h1>
    <h2>Apple filed a lawsuit against Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti in July, alleging they stole trade secrets about iOS 26 by breaking into a former Apple engineer's development iPhone, with Prosser subsequently leaking details on his YouTube channel. Recently, Apple obtained a default judgment against Prosser for missing his deadline to respond to the complaint, seeking monetary damages and an injunction. Prosser, however, denies ignoring the case, asserting he has been in active communication with Apple since the lawsuit began.</h2>
