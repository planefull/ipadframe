    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses, addressing privacy risks associated with linking user activity. It utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information (e.g., age or employment) without revealing underlying data or identifiers that could connect separate interactions. Crescent is designed to work efficiently on mobile devices through a two-stage proof generation process and integrates with existing credential systems without requiring updates from issuers, thereby enhancing user privacy against tracking.</h2>
