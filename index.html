    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," discussed by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and guests, exposed a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass current biosecurity screening systems, akin to a cybersecurity threat. To address this, a cross-sector team developed AI red-teaming methods to strengthen protein screening and implemented a cybersecurity-style emergency response, leading to updated biosecurity protocols shared globally. This work, published in *Science*, also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data sharing in dual-use research, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards.</h2>
