    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to address the limitations of current AI models in analyzing long-form video and large image collections. Built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture, MMCTAgent uses iterative, tool-based reasoning to analyze complex queries across various modalities. This approach, featuring specialized VideoAgent and ImageAgent components, significantly improves performance on multimodal reasoning tasks by enabling structured self-evaluation and extensibility.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Mac Plans</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning a significant refresh of its Mac lineup throughout 2026, with most models expected to receive M5 chips, and potentially the first M6 chips by year-end. Early 2026 updates include the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, alongside the debut of a new, more affordable 13-inch MacBook featuring an A18 Pro chip. Later in the year, M5 Max/Ultra chips are slated for the Mac mini and Mac Studio, while a redesigned OLED MacBook Pro with a touchscreen and M6 chip is also a possibility.</h2>
