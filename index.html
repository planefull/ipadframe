    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project identified a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a collaborative cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style red-teaming approach, created updated, more robust screening mechanisms, and successfully deployed these "patches" to the global gene synthesis industry. This initiative significantly strengthened AI-resilient biosecurity and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive dual-use research data and methods, offering a model for future challenges in rapidly advancing fields.</h2>

    <h1>macOS 26.1 Beta Hints at Pro Display XDR 2 With Center Stage Camera</h1>
    <h2>Apple has released the third beta of macOS 26.1, which contains code strings hinting at a potential Pro Display XDR 2 featuring a built-in camera. This new version of the high-end monitor is expected to include Center Stage and Desk View capabilities, features currently found in the Studio Display. The addition of a camera would address a long-standing criticism of the original Pro Display XDR, which lacks a built-in camera despite its steep starting price.</h2>
