    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to enhance privacy in digital identity systems by introducing "unlinkability." It addresses the risk of tracking user behavior by preventing separate uses of digital credentials, such as mobile driver's licenses or app logins, from being linked together. Crescent achieves this through zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices with a two-stage process, allowing users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or allowing their interactions to be connected.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26: 5 New Features in the Wallet App</h1>
    <h2>The iOS 26 Wallet app introduces several significant new features, including enhanced order tracking that utilizes Apple Intelligence to monitor all online purchases, not just those made with Apple Pay. Users can now add a U.S. passport as a Digital ID for domestic travel at select TSA checkpoints and for identity verification online or in-store. Additionally, boarding passes receive upgrades with airport maps, Find My integration for luggage, Live Activities support for real-time flight updates, and the app adds a section to store full credit card details and an option to disable promotional offers.</h2>
