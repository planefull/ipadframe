    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, a collaborative effort led by Microsoft's Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, revealed a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team, including experts from Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, responded by developing an AI red-teaming pipeline to identify such evasive sequences and subsequently created "patches" to bolster global protein screening capabilities. This project underscores the dual-use nature of AI in biology, advocating for a proactive, collaborative approach akin to cybersecurity—including novel methods for responsible disclosure—to safeguard against emerging biological risks while maximizing beneficial innovation.</h2>
