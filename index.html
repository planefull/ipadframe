    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled with efficiently providing accurate answers to professional users due to vast product data, complex parameters, and diverse documentation. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system built on Microsoft Azure. This enhanced system, capable of understanding multimodal content, establishing end-to-end knowledge loops, and performing multi-hop reasoning, achieved a 12% improvement in answer accuracy and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across industries.</h2>

    <h1>Happy 24th Anniversary, iPod</h1>
    <h2>The first-generation iPod launched on November 10, 2001, its 24th anniversary, following various rumors about its identity before release. Despite initial complaints about its high price and Mac-only compatibility, the innovative device quickly became popular for its storage and design, establishing Apple's product launch traditions and paving the way for the iPhone. The iPod line officially ended in 2022, but its legacy "lives on" in Apple's current products, with potential future devices referencing its iconic name.</h2>
