    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is a novel, automated red-teaming agent designed to thoroughly evaluate the safety and security of AI-powered code agents, addressing the limitations of traditional static benchmarks. It utilizes an adaptive memory, a specialized toolbox including code substitution, and simulated sandbox environments to learn from attack experiences and assess real-world code execution behaviors. This approach allows RedCodeAgent to achieve higher attack success rates, discover previously unknown vulnerabilities across various programming languages and code agents, and adapt its strategies effectively compared to existing methods.</h2>
