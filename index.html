    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for emails or price drops because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and context management, allowing them to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. This approach, implemented in Magentic-UI, significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
