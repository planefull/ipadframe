    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to wasted resources or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This innovation allows agents to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving reliability for extended tasks and laying the groundwork for more proactive and enduring AI assistants.</h2>
