    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI infrastructure faces a "networking wall" due where current copper and optical communication links present trade-offs in power, reliability, and reach, significantly limiting GPU utilization and system scalability. Microsoft Research's MOSAIC technology resolves this by employing a novel "wide-and-slow" optical link architecture, leveraging hundreds of parallel low-speed channels powered by microLEDs. This approach simultaneously delivers copper-like power efficiency and reliability over long distances (up to 50 meters), enabling substantial power savings, reduced failure rates, and new, more scalable AI network and cluster architectures.</h2>
