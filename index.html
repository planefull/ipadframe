    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which uncovered a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing DNA synthesis screening systems. A cross-sector team then collaborated to develop and implement "patches"—more robust protein screening methods—and shared them globally to strengthen biosecurity defenses against these AI-generated sequences. This initiative demonstrated a "zero-day" vulnerability in AI biosecurity and established a new model for responsible disclosure and ongoing international cooperation to manage the dual-use risks of emerging AI capabilities.</h2>
