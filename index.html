    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its recent paper, stating its primary goal was to identify occupations where AI chatbots, like Bing Copilot, are most useful for assisting with specific tasks. The study found AI is most applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks, such as writing and information gathering, suggesting it can serve as a tool to enhance workflows. Crucially, the research explicitly *does not* conclude that AI will eliminate jobs, emphasizing that AI is intended to complement human strengths rather than replace entire occupations.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the forthcoming iPhone 17 Air, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Similar to the iPhone 4's rubber bumper, this case would cover only the device's edges, offering protection without adding significant bulk to the expected ultra-thin design. Additionally, Apple is rumored to be planning an iPhone 17 Air battery case, with both accessories anticipated to be unveiled alongside the iPhone 17 series in September.</h2>
