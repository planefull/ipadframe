    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to professional users due to vast product data, complex parameters, and diverse technical documentation. To overcome this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This specialized RAG system, which handles multimodal documents, uses end-to-end knowledge loops, and performs multi-hop reasoning, significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% in a proof-of-concept, validating its effectiveness for complex industrial knowledge management.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 18 Pro May Drop Rear Two-Tone Appearance for a Unified Look</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 18 Pro models are rumored to drop the current two-tone rear casing in favor of a more seamless, unified aesthetic. This change would minimize the color difference between the aluminum frame and the back-glass MagSafe cutout, which gives the iPhone 17 Pro its distinct two-tone appearance. This information comes from a Chinese leaker, Instant Digital, and potentially aligns with a separate rumor about a slightly transparent Ceramic Shield design.</h2>
