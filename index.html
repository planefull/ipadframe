    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team used an AI "red-teaming" pipeline to generate thousands of these evasive protein variants, subsequently developing and implementing "patches" to strengthen global biosecurity screening tools. This collaborative effort not only improved defenses but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data and software sharing in dual-use research, balancing open science with minimizing misuse risks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning a staggered release for its M5 MacBook Pro lineup, with a base model featuring the M5 chip expected to launch soon. Higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, equipped with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, are then anticipated to follow in early 2026. This split launch strategy, supported by FCC documents and macOS testing, marks a return to a past release trend for Apple's professional laptops.</h2>
