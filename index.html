    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast, complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and difficult reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated to design a generative AI assistant that enhances genetic professionals' "sensemaking" workflows. This AI tool aims to streamline diagnosis by automatically flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>Top Stories: iOS 26.1 Beta, iPhone Scratches, Apple TV Rumors, and More</h1>
    <h2>The Apple world is busy with the release of iOS 26.1 beta 1, which expands Apple Intelligence languages and brings new design tweaks, while also anticipating new Apple TV hardware and the iOS 26 Wallet Passport feature later this year. Concerns have arisen regarding the easy scratching of some iPhone 17 Pro and Air models, though Apple attributes it to store chargers, and a one-year experiment evaluated the effectiveness of the 80% charge limit on battery health. Lastly, students should note that Apple's "Back to School" promotion, now including AirPods Pro 3, is ending soon.</h2>
