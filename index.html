    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the overwhelming and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI-based assistant to support these professionals in their data interpretation and "sensemaking" tasks. This AI aims to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>
