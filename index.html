    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and extensive reanalysis efforts. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated to design a generative AI assistant to streamline the analysis process. This AI tool is designed to enhance efficiency by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>
