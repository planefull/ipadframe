    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and challenges in prioritizing reanalysis, often leaving cases unsolved. Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated to design a generative AI assistant to address these issues. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models are reportedly nearing mass production, with a release window expected between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, according to Mark Gurman. These initial 14-inch and 16-inch models are anticipated to be powered by M5/M5 Pro/M5 Max chips but will lack other significant design changes. However, a more substantial update is rumored for late 2026, bringing an OLED touch screen, a thinner design, M6 chips fabricated with a 2nm process, and potentially cellular connectivity.</h2>
