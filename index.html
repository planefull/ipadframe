    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is challenging for genetic professionals due to vast data, information overload, and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI assistant designed to support genetic professionals in synthesizing biomedical data. This AI-enhanced tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and aggregating scientific literature, ultimately increasing diagnostic rates and improving patient outcomes for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro Top Last Yearâ€™s Phones in Bend and Drop Tests</h1>
    <h2>Allstate Protection Plans conducted bend and drop tests on the new iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro models, demonstrating improved durability compared to last year's iPhones. Both devices, featuring Ceramic Shield 2 and durable frames (titanium for Air, aluminum for 17 Pro), showed significant resistance to bending, with the 17 Pro models performing slightly better. However, face-down drops from six feet still resulted in shattered displays for both the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro, highlighting the continued need for protective measures like cases or insurance.</h2>
