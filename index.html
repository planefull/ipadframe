    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that revolutionizes 3D rendering by replacing traditional physics-based methods with a purely machine learning approach. This transformer-based model can perform full-featured 3D rendering, including arbitrary 3D geometry, material data, and complex global illumination, without relying on conventional graphics computations like ray tracing or rasterization. RenderFormer represents a significant step toward a general-purpose neural rendering model, offering greater generalizability and potential for integration into advanced AI systems for applications in gaming, film, and virtual reality.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: What's Exclusive to Apple's Largest Flagship iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Before Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, rumors suggested the Pro Max would have exclusive features, but both models share the same general feature set this year. The primary differences are the Pro Max's larger 6.9-inch display, longer battery life (up to 39 hours of video playback), and a new maximum storage option of 2TB. Therefore, choosing the smaller iPhone 17 Pro only means missing out on a larger screen, extended battery life, and the highest 2TB storage capacity.</h2>
