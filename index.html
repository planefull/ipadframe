    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient technical answers to professional users due to complex product data and limitations of traditional RAG systems. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, implementing PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This enhanced system improved answer accuracy by 12% by effectively parsing multimodal documents, leveraging original data sources, and employing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for intricate queries.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Cheap MacBook: What to Expect in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning to release a low-cost MacBook in the first half of 2026, aiming to compete with affordable Chromebooks and Windows PCs by offering a macOS device priced below the $999 MacBook Air. This budget-friendly laptop is expected to feature a 13-inch standard LCD display, come in bright colors, and be powered by an A18 Pro chip, making it suitable for everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, and light photo/video editing. While specific pricing is unconfirmed, estimates suggest it could fall between $499 and $799, providing a more accessible entry point to the Mac ecosystem and supporting Apple Intelligence features.</h2>
