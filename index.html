    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified their recent paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," which aimed to identify where AI chatbots could be most useful across different occupations. The study found AI to be most applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks, like writing and gathering information, suggesting it as a tool to assist with specific subtasks and improve workflows. Crucially, the authors emphasized that their research explicitly *did not* conclude that jobs would be eliminated by AI, cautioning against such misinterpretations.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Similar to the iPhone 4 bumper, this case would protect the device's edges without adding significant bulk, a suitable option given the 17 Air's expected ultra-thin design. Furthermore, Apple is also rumored to be planning an iPhone 17 Air battery case, with both accessories anticipated to launch alongside the new iPhone series in September.</h2>
