    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image libraries, as they are limited to short-clip analysis and single-pass answers. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. MMCTAgent utilizes modality-specific agents with specialized tools, enabling it to perform deliberate analysis, evaluate intermediate results, and refine conclusions for complex queries across extensive visual data, significantly enhancing performance and explainability.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>According to the Financial Times, Apple is preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO as soon as next year, with the company's board and senior executives reportedly intensifying transition preparations. A smooth leadership handover could occur early next year, with John Ternus, Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, widely viewed as Cook's most likely successor. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has pushed back on the report, stating he doesn't believe anything is imminent, though the succession plans are unrelated to Apple's current strong financial performance.</h2>
