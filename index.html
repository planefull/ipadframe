    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," co-led by Microsoft's Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed more robust AI-resilient screening solutions, akin to cybersecurity patches, which were shared globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC). This collaborative effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing access to sensitive dual-use research data, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards for future advancements in biosecurity.</h2>
