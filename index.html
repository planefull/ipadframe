    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check conditions, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system that uses dynamic polling and careful context management to enable agents to monitor conditions for extended periods. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
