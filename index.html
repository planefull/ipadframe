    <h1>BlueCodeAgent: A blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming for CodeGen AI</h1>
    <h2>Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation often introduce security risks, such as malicious, biased, or vulnerable code, with current defensive "blue teaming" methods proving insufficient due to poor alignment with security concepts and over-conservatism. To address this, Microsoft Research and collaborators developed BlueCodeAgent, a novel framework that leverages comprehensive automated "red teaming" to generate diverse risky scenarios, which are then distilled into actionable safety "constitutions." This knowledge-enhanced blue teaming, combined with dynamic sandbox-based testing, significantly improves the detection of unsafe inputs and code outputs, reducing both false positives and false negatives, and demonstrates superior performance across various risk categories and LLMs.</h2>
