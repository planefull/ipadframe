    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, create significant privacy risks due to "linkability," which allows various credential uses to be associated with an individual, enabling extensive tracking and profiling. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices, to enable users to selectively disclose information without revealing linking identifiers, thereby protecting privacy without requiring major infrastructure updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Air is Launching Soon, Here Are All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is heralded as the biggest design update since the iPhone X, poised to be Apple's thinnest iPhone yet at just 5.5mm, with a lighter 6.6-inch LTPO OLED display featuring rumored 120Hz ProMotion. It will be powered by an A19 chip with 12GB RAM and an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, supporting Qi 2.2 wireless charging and Wi-Fi 7. However, its ultra-slim design necessitates a smaller 2,800mAh battery and a single 48-megapixel rear camera, which may result in notably worse battery life and limited spatial video capabilities.</h2>
