    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnosis rates and prolonged reanalysis processes. A study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored the design of a generative AI assistant to address these issues by enhancing genetic professionals' "sensemaking" tasks. This AI-powered prototype aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>
