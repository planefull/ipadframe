    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified their recent paper, stating it identified occupations where AI chatbots could be useful for assisting with tasks, not that jobs would be eliminated. The research found AI most applicable to knowledge work and communication, such as writing and information gathering, rather than physical tasks. They emphasized that the study focused on AI as an assistive tool, acknowledging methodological limitations and cautioning against drawing conclusions about job displacement.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, as suggested by Mark Gurman. This case would cover only the device's edges, offering a compromise between protection and maintaining the expected ultra-thin design, reminiscent of the iPhone 4's bumper. Additionally, Apple is rumored to be planning a battery case for the iPhone 17 Air, which would provide extra power for the device.</h2>
