    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to provide accurate and efficient technical answers to professional users due to vast product data, complex parameters, and diverse documentation formats that traditional RAG systems couldn't handle. To overcome this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, integrating PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by effectively parsing multimodal documents, using original data sources for trustworthiness, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries.</h2>
