    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability: AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. The team developed a "red-teaming" approach to generate AI-paraphrased toxic protein variants, then designed and implemented robust "patches" for screening software, which have since been shared worldwide to strengthen biosecurity. This initiative established a new model for addressing AI-driven dual-use dilemmas, combining technical solutions with novel transparency and data-sharing protocols to proactively manage emerging biological risks.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to launch M5 MacBook Air models in spring 2026, while M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models are expected early that year, with these initial updates primarily focusing on chip upgrades rather than design changes. A more significant MacBook Pro refresh featuring thinner, lighter OLED models with touchscreens is anticipated in late 2026 or early 2027, and the MacBook Air may see display and design tweaks in 2027. Additionally, Apple is developing new M5 Pro/Max versions of the Mac Studio and Mac mini, along with two external displays, including a second-generation Studio Display.</h2>
