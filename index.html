    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form video and large image collections, which current single-pass inference methods cannot adequately address. To overcome this, Microsoft Research introduced MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. This system, featuring modality-specific agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent, leverages specialized tools and self-evaluation to significantly improve performance on benchmarks, offering explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal understanding.</h2>

    <h1>Google Launches More Intelligent Gemini 3 Model</h1>
    <h2>Google has launched Gemini 3 Pro, its newest and most intelligent AI model, which offers state-of-the-art reasoning, enhanced contextual understanding, and superior multimodal capabilities, outperforming previous versions. The model is rolling out across various Google platforms, including AI Mode in Search and the redesigned Gemini app, with an even more intelligent Gemini 3 Deep Think mode planned for Ultra subscribers. Alongside the AI's launch, the Gemini app received a modern redesign, improving chat and organization, and introducing new interfaces with immersive visual layouts and dynamic, custom user experiences.</h2>
