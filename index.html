    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its recent paper on AI and occupations, stating it identified generative AI as most useful for assisting with knowledge work and communication tasks like writing and information gathering across various jobs. The study explicitly did not conclude that AI would eliminate jobs, cautioning against misinterpretations of its findings on task applicability. Researchers emphasized that their methodology, which maps user queries to the O*NET database, does not capture the full complexity and nuance of occupations, positioning AI as a tool to complement human strengths rather than replace roles.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3 Coming This Fall â€“ Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>Despite being over two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium earbud market thanks to their top-tier audio, noise cancellation, and continuous software updates, creating a dilemma for buyers as AirPods Pro 3 are rumored to arrive soon. Expected to launch in September 2025 alongside the iPhone 17, the Pro 3 could feature a refreshed design, significantly improved active noise cancellation, and new health sensors like heart-rate and temperature detection. Additionally, these next-generation earbuds are anticipated to offer on-device live translation and other software enhancements, making them a potentially significant upgrade for those willing to wait.</h2>
