    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose privacy risks, primarily due to "linkability" where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be tracked and linked. To combat this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process (prepare and show) to allow users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing linking data or requiring issuing organizations to update their systems, ensuring privacy across interactions.</h2>
