    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and associate a user's various digital activities. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and preprocessing to enable users to verify specific information about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or linking separate interactions, all without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Next Vehicle With CarPlay Ultra Named in Report as Rollout Continues</h1>
    <h2>Hyundai's upcoming IONIQ 3 electric vehicle is reportedly set to feature Apple's advanced CarPlay Ultra system, according to *Top Gear*. Described as a smaller, more affordable EV, the IONIQ 3 will offer up to 365 miles of range and a digital-forward interface, with a concept version debuting in September ahead of a 2026 launch. This makes the IONIQ 3 a notable addition to the expanding list of vehicles supporting CarPlay Ultra, which offers deep integration with vehicle systems and customizable interfaces beyond standard CarPlay.</h2>
