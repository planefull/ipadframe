    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to generate these "paraphrased" toxic proteins and collaborated to create more robust screening solutions, which were shared globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium. This effort not only strengthened biosecurity defenses but also established a new model for responsible disclosure and management of AI-related information hazards in scientific research.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Announces iPhone 17 and iPhone Air Release Date in Indonesia</h1>
    <h2>Apple has announced that customers in Indonesia can pre-order the new iPhone 17 lineup, including the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, starting Friday, October 10. The devices will then be available in select Indonesian stores a week later, on October 17. While these models launched last month in many other regions, the iPhone Air is still awaiting eSIM regulatory approval in China, delaying its release there.</h2>
