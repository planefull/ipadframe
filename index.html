    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>This article clarifies a previous Microsoft Research paper, emphasizing that its findings on AI's occupational implications were misinterpreted as predicting job elimination. The original study actually analyzed how generative AI, specifically Bing Copilot, could assist with tasks, finding it most useful for knowledge-based activities like writing and information gathering across various occupations. The authors explicitly state their research does not conclude that jobs will be replaced by AI, highlighting the importance of understanding methodological limitations and viewing AI as a tool to complement human strengths.</h2>

    <h1>2026 Foldable iPhone: All the Leaks So Far</h1>
    <h2>Apple is widely rumored to launch its first foldable iPhone in 2026, adopting a book-style design with a virtually crease-free inner display. The device is expected to feature dual screens (a 5.5-inch outer and a 7.8-inch inner), a durable titanium chassis with liquid metal hinges, Touch ID, and an advanced C2 modem. Anticipated to be a premium product, it could be priced between $1,800 and $2,500.</h2>
