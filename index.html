    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is increasingly limited by networking bottlenecks, stemming from a fundamental trade-off in existing copper and optical communication technologies that restrict reach, power efficiency, or reliability. Microsoft Research has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology that addresses this by employing a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed channels using microLEDs. This approach simultaneously delivers low power consumption, high reliability, and long reach (up to 50 meters), promising significant energy savings and enabling more scalable and flexible AI infrastructure designs.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Introduces 'Groundbreaking' New Memory Security Feature</h1>
    <h2>Apple has introduced a "groundbreaking" new memory security feature called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) with its iPhone 17 lineup, described as the most significant upgrade to memory safety in consumer operating systems. This feature targets sophisticated spyware like Pegasus by offering comprehensive, always-on protection for the kernel and userland processes, built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by the new A19 chips. MIE aims to make mercenary spyware significantly more expensive and difficult to develop, thereby redefining the memory safety landscape for Apple products with virtually no CPU cost.</h2>
