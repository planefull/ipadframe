    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. SentinelStep achieves this by using dynamic polling intervals and careful context management, significantly improving the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, thereby enabling more practical and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>A20 and A20 Pro Chips (2nm) Expected to Debut in These iPhone Models</h1>
    <h2>A new rumor suggests Apple is planning two versions of its A20 chip, the A20 and A20 Pro, for the upcoming iPhone 18 series. These chips are expected to be the first iPhone processors manufactured using TSMC's advanced 2nm process, promising significant year-over-year performance and power efficiency improvements. The standard iPhone 18 will reportedly receive the A20 chip, while the iPhone 18 Pro models and the anticipated foldable iPhone will be equipped with the more powerful A20 Pro.</h2>
