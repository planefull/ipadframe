    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively developed an AI-based assistant designed to enhance data analysis and information synthesis. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and aggregating crucial gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3 Impossible to Repair, Earn Score of 0 in iFixit Teardown</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the AirPods Pro 3 revealed internal changes compared to the AirPods Pro 2, including a new foam-infused ear tip and a single battery cell in the charging case, which reduces battery life. While some magnets were repositioned, the design remains largely glued together, making repair nearly impossible. Consequently, iFixit awarded the AirPods Pro 3 a dismal 0 out of 10 for repairability, highlighting their "e-waste nightmare" nature.</h2>
