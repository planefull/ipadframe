    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, in ways that evaded existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team responded by developing a cybersecurity-style red-teaming approach, creating and validating a more robust protein screening system that was subsequently shared with global synthesis companies. This effort not only strengthened biosecurity defenses but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific data and methods, setting a precedent for managing information hazards in dual-use AI research.</h2>
