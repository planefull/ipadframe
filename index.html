    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring due to their inability to intelligently wait and check for updates, leading to wasted resources or missed events. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that allows agents to complete long-running monitoring tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context effectively. This approach, implemented in Magentic-UI, significantly improves agent reliability for tasks spanning hours or days, paving the way for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Review: Bird Buddy's Hummingbird Feeder and Accessories Put Nature at Your Fingertips</h1>
    <h2>Bird Buddy offers a camera-equipped bird feeder, which has expanded to include an upgraded Pro camera with 2K video, a Hummingbird Feeder, and a durable Nature Station pole system. The products integrate with an app that sends "postcards" of visiting birds and provides identification, though AI accuracy can sometimes vary. Overall, the reviewer highly recommends Bird Buddy feeders for their durability and engaging way to experience nature, despite minor maintenance needs and app inconsistencies.</h2>
