    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and the complexity of reanalyzing cases. A study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored integrating a generative AI assistant to streamline these tasks, enhance data synthesis, and improve diagnostic workflows. This AI assistant is designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and aggregate crucial gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to increase diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
