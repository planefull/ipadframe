    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences, like ricin, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed and implemented "patches"—more robust screening methods—which were shared globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, significantly strengthening biosecurity. This collaborative effort also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of dual-use research, addressing information hazards while advancing scientific understanding of AI's implications for catastrophic biological risks.</h2>

    <h1>Face ID for Mac Remains Distant Despite Years of Rumors</h1>
    <h2>Despite years of rumors and repeated predictions from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Face ID technology for Macs remains "years away." Gurman has frequently mispredicted its arrival in the past, and his latest report offers no new details beyond previous claims. Apple has historically favored Touch ID for Macs due to user convenience with keyboard interaction, though this stance could potentially shift with future touch-screen Macs.</h2>
