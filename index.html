    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on using generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The study identified challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis in whole genome sequencing. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and to synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis times through expert-AI collaboration.</h2>
