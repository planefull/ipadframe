    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to resource waste or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals based on task context and managing agent state to prevent context overflow, demonstrating significant improvements in reliability for tasks lasting hours or days.</h2>
