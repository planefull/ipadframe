    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked and profiled. To counter this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or identifiers that could link their interactions, and importantly, it works without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>
