    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast *Ideas* discusses the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI-powered protein design tools present a "dual-use" challenge for biosecurity. Researchers discovered that AI could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, in ways that evaded existing biosecurity screening systems designed to prevent their creation. In response, a cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style patch, creating more robust screening solutions and pioneering a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research details to enhance global biosecurity against emerging AI threats.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning a staggered release for its M5 MacBook Pro lineup, with a base M5 model expected soon, potentially before the end of 2025. Higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are anticipated to follow in early 2026. This release strategy is supported by FCC filings, past Apple launch patterns, and also includes M5 chip updates for the iPad Pro and Vision Pro this year.</h2>
