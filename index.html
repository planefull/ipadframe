    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade current biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative, cross-sector team then developed and implemented robust "patches" to these screening methods, which were shared globally to strengthen defenses against AI-enabled misuse. This pioneering effort also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific information, underscoring the ongoing need for vigilance and cooperation in managing AI's dual-use risks in biotechnology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to release a base MacBook Pro with the standard M5 chip in late 2025, according to sources familiar with macOS Tahoe development. Higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to follow in early 2026. This split launch strategy, which has historical precedent, also suggests that other devices like the iPad Pro and Vision Pro will receive the M5 chip, offering notable performance improvements.</h2>
