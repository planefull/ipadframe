    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and lengthy reanalysis processes. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to design a generative AI-based assistant to support these professionals. This AI assistant aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new findings, and facilitating collaboration, ultimately improving diagnostic yields and patient outcomes for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Next iPad Pro to Have Two Key Features, But One Rumor Still Uncertain</h1>
    <h2>The next 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models are expected to feature Apple's M5 chip and an increased minimum of 12GB of RAM, based on leaked unboxing videos from previously reliable Russian YouTube channels. Benchmarks from these videos show the M5 chip offering up to 12% faster multi-core CPU and 36% faster graphics performance than the M4 chip. While a rumor about two front cameras for the new models remains uncertain, no major design changes are expected, and the devices will likely be unveiled this month.</h2>
