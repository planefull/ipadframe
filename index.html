    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and carefully managing context. Integrated into the Magentic-UI agentic system, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability for longer durations, paving the way for more proactive, efficient, and user-aligned AI assistants.</h2>
