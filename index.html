    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is a novel, fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety of large language model-based code agents, specifically addressing the shortcomings of existing static benchmarks in assessing real-world execution risks. It operates with a memory module for continuous learning, a specialized toolbox including code substitution, and integrates simulated sandbox environments to assess the impact of generated code. This innovative approach consistently achieves higher attack success rates, lower rejection rates, and uncovers previously unknown vulnerabilities across diverse code agents and programming languages, significantly outperforming traditional jailbreak methods.</h2>
