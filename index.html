    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they either check obsessively and waste resources or give up too quickly. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for extended tasks, making them more proactive and resource-efficient, and is open-sourced as part of the Magentic-UI prototype.</h2>

    <h1>OpenAI Acquires Apple Shortcuts Creators to Bring Deep Mac Integration to ChatGPT</h1>
    <h2>OpenAI has acquired Software Applications Incorporated and its AI app, Sky, along with its team of former Apple employees. Sky's founders, Ari Weinstein and Conrad Kramer, previously created the popular Workflow app, which Apple later acquired and transformed into its Shortcuts feature. OpenAI plans to integrate Sky's deep macOS capabilities, which allow it to act as a natural language AI assistant across Mac windows, into ChatGPT to enhance its functionality.</h2>
