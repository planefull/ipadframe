    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate credential uses to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs with preprocessing to enable users to selectively disclose information and prevent their digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring changes to existing issuing systems.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3 Said to Gain Two Health Sensors, But Translation Delayed</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming AirPods Pro 3 are reportedly set to include in-ear temperature and heart-rate sensing, according to an anonymous tip received by 9to5Mac. While these health features are confirmed for launch, the much-rumored live translation capability will be delayed and is expected in a future software update, relying on the iPhone's Translate app. These new AirPods Pro, which align with Apple's health accessory push, are anticipated to be unveiled alongside the iPhone 17 models at Apple's September 9 event.</h2>
