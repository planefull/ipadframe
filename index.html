    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is a complex and time-consuming process for genetic professionals due to the vast amounts of whole genome sequencing data requiring extensive sensemaking. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed a generative AI assistant to address these challenges. This AI-powered tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods 4 vs. AirPods Pro 3 Buyer's Guide: 25 Differences Compared</h1>
    <h2>Apple's latest AirPods 4, especially with an additional $50 for active noise cancellation, now share many features with the AirPods Pro 3, making them a default choice for many. However, the AirPods Pro 3 ($249) offer significantly more effective noise cancellation due to their in-ear fit, longer earbud battery life, and exclusive features like heart rate monitoring, advanced hearing tools, and precision finding. Ultimately, while AirPods 4 suit most users seeking comfort and value, the AirPods Pro 3 are better for those prioritizing superior noise cancellation, an in-ear fit, and advanced health and audio capabilities.</h2>
