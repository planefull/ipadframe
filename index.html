    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, allowing them to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A collaborative team developed an AI-powered red-teaming pipeline to expose these weaknesses and then implemented "patches" to create more robust, AI-resilient protein screening methods. This effort not only strengthened global biosecurity but also pioneered a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research on dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>OpenAI's Sora AI Video App Hits 1 Million Downloads</h1>
    <h2>OpenAI's Sora, an AI app for generating videos, has rapidly surpassed one million downloads since its release at the end of September. This milestone was achieved faster than ChatGPT, despite Sora being invite-only and currently limited to the U.S. and Canada. The app allows users to create AI-powered videos from their uploaded "cameos" using the advanced Sora 2 model, and despite some criticism, it remains highly popular and tops free app charts.</h2>
