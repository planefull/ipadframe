    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an open-source framework built on AutoGen that uses a Planner–Critic architecture. This design enables MMCTAgent to perform structured, iterative reasoning, leveraging specialized tools for image and video analysis to significantly enhance performance and provide explainable insights across diverse multimodal tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Tim Cook Might Not Fully Retire After Stepping Down as Apple CEO — Here's Why</h1>
    <h2>According to a *Financial Times* report, Apple is preparing for CEO Tim Cook to step down as early as next year. Cook may not fully retire but instead transition to chairman of Apple's board of directors. This move is supported by current chairman Arthur D. Levinson reaching the company's age-75 re-election limit, potentially creating an opening for Cook to take on that role.</h2>
