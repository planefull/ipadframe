    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly enhances agent reliability for extended monitoring tasks, demonstrating marked improvements in success rates for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Amazon Music Now Features Alexa+</h1>
    <h2>Amazon has integrated its upgraded AI-driven assistant, Alexa+, into the Amazon Music app on iOS and Android, currently available in beta to early access program members across all subscription tiers. This new feature enables users to discover, organize, and interact with music through natural conversation, asking complex questions or requesting tailored playlists. Alexa+ has shown to significantly increase music exploration and listening, and will eventually be free for Amazon Prime members, marking a major generative AI integration in a mainstream streaming service.</h2>
