    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and complex reanalysis of whole genome sequencing data, leading to a low initial diagnosis rate. To address these issues, Microsoft Research, in partnership with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool is designed to enhance genetic professionals' workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating crucial gene and variant information, thereby aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Leaks Reveal What Apple Products Are Coming Next</h1>
    <h2>The MacRumors Show discusses significant leaks regarding upcoming Apple products, including an unboxing video of an M5-powered iPad Pro with no external design changes, and FCC documents hinting at new MacBook Pro and Vision Pro models. Mark Gurman also revealed Apple's plans for two new external monitors, while the company has reportedly halted development on a cheaper Vision Air and a true second-generation Vision Pro, shifting focus to smart glasses. The episode explores these product revelations, their implications, and Apple's apparent change in strategy for its Vision headsets.</h2>
