    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or premature failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by integrating dynamic polling and careful context management within their workflows. Implemented in Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks spanning hours or days, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 18 Rumored to Feature 50% More RAM</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming iPhone 18 is rumored to feature 50% more memory than its predecessor, with all models potentially reaching 12GB or more. This significant increase is largely driven by the demands of on-device artificial intelligence processing, a factor already leading iPhone 17 Pro models to include 12GB of RAM compared to the standard iPhone 17's 8GB. To achieve this memory parity across the iPhone 18 lineup, Apple has reportedly asked key suppliers like Samsung to increase their supply of higher-capacity LPDDR5X chips.</h2>
