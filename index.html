    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex, long-form video and large-scale image data, failing at tasks requiring deep temporal reasoning and cross-modal integration. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This agent, with its specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent, integrates tools for ingestion, retrieval, and self-evaluation, allowing it to analyze vast visual collections with enhanced accuracy, explainability, and scalability.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</h1>
    <h2>A Texas judge denied Apple and OpenAI's request to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI startup, meaning the case will proceed. xAI sued the companies in August 2025, accusing them of conspiring to monopolize the AI market by exclusively integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT with Siri. xAI claims this partnership unfairly disadvantages rival chatbots like its Grok, limiting user choice and access to vital data, and seeks to end the alleged anti-competitive practices and recover damages.</h2>
