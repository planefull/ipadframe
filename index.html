    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and delayed reanalysis of unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI-based assistant to enhance the sensemaking process for these professionals. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Work on Lighter Vision Pro to Fast-Track AI Smart Glasses</h1>
    <h2>Apple has paused development on a lighter and cheaper version of its Vision Pro headset, including the rumored "Vision Air," to instead prioritize smart glasses. The company is reallocating engineers to fast-track its smart glasses project to compete with Meta's AI-equipped Ray-Ban glasses. Apple's upcoming smart glasses will feature cameras, microphones, AI capabilities, and iPhone reliance, with an integrated display model being developed more rapidly to rival Meta's recent display-equipped release.</h2>
