    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed and deployed "patches" to these screening systems, significantly enhancing their ability to detect AI-generated threats across a broader range of dangerous proteins. This effort established a new model for responsible disclosure and ongoing defense against dual-use AI risks in biology, featuring a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive information and calling for continuous proactive measures and policy development.</h2>

    <h1>Facebook's New Collage Feature May Use Your Images for AI Training</h1>
    <h2>Meta is launching an opt-in, AI-based collage and photo editing tool for Facebook that scans your camera roll to create "fun collages and edits." This feature generates private suggestions like collages or themed recaps, which users can choose to share. However, sharing any AI-created content means your images will be used for Meta's AI training, so users concerned about privacy are advised to restrict Facebook's camera roll access.</h2>
