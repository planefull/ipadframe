    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI-powered tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, allowing them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style "red-teaming" approach to identify and fix these weaknesses, leading to more robust protein screening systems. The project also introduced a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive data, setting a precedent for responsible disclosure and proactive defense against AI's dual-use risks in synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Stock Price Reaches New All-Time High</h1>
    <h2>Apple's stock price reached a new all-time high today, trading as high as $263.47 and exceeding its previous record set in December 2024. This achievement is largely driven by strong demand for the new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, despite softer sales for the iPhone Air and Apple's continued lag in generative AI. The company, which has had five stock splits since going public, is scheduled to release its next quarterly earnings report on October 30.</h2>
