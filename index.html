    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The rapid growth of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling a "society of agents" and "tools" through horizontal integration, which expands capabilities but also introduces new challenges. This proliferation leads to "tool-space interference," where diverse tools can cause issues like excessive counts, long response lengths, complex parameters, and naming conflicts, hindering overall agent effectiveness. To address this, the article recommends protocol enhancements such as formal namespaces and better client-provided resource handling, alongside best practices for server, client, and marketplace developers to improve compatibility, usability, and optimization within the ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>Three Days Until iOS 26 Launch: What Are You Most Looking Forward To?</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 is launching in three days, introducing a new "Liquid Glass" design with translucent UI elements, rounded menus, and simplified navigation. This design has been contentious among beta testers regarding the level of translucency and its impact on readability. Alongside the visual overhaul, the update will also bring various new features such as call screening, custom snooze durations, Genmoji, and Live Translation.</h2>
