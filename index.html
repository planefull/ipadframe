    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to efficiently manage waiting periods and context. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This enables agents to reliably monitor conditions for extended periods (hours or days) without wasting resources, significantly improving their performance on such tasks.</h2>

This week also saw the release of iOS 26.1 beta 4, which introduces a new toggle for the Liquid Glass design's transparency, alongside fresh rumors detailing Apple's plans for three future iPhone designs, including foldable models. Separately, General Motors announced its decision to remove CarPlay from all its future vehicles, including gas-powered ones, in favor of its native infotainment system.</h2>
