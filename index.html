    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to vast data, information overload, and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline this process. The AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving patient outcomes for rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, which means users who have upgraded to the newer iOS 26 can no longer downgrade to the older version. This action prevents the installation of outdated, less secure software, as signed software passes Apple's necessary server-side verification check. While upgrading to iOS 26 is optional, once a device is updated, there is no longer a path to revert for iPhones, iPads, or Apple TVs.</h2>
