    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project investigated the "dual-use" challenge of AI in protein design, revealing that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, a vulnerability dubbed a "zero day." A cross-sector team successfully generated thousands of AI-rewritten toxic protein variants that evaded detection, prompting the rapid development and implementation of more robust screening "patches." This initiative not only strengthened global biosecurity against AI-enabled threats but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for responsibly sharing sensitive research data to balance open science with minimizing misuse risks.</h2>

    <h1>Facebook's New Collage Feature May Use Your Images for AI Training</h1>
    <h2>Meta is launching a new opt-in AI-based collage and photo editing tool for Facebook users in the U.S. and Canada, which scans camera rolls to suggest "fun collages and edits." This feature privately suggests photo and video edits for users to post, appearing in Stories and Feed, and requires users to opt-in through settings. While camera roll media isn't used for AI training unless shared, users are advised to avoid enabling the feature or restrict Facebook's camera roll access if they don't want their images used for AI training, as Meta is generally loosening privacy policies for AI development.</h2>
