    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," led by Microsoft and collaborators, uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. Researchers developed a red-teaming pipeline that generated AI-rewritten versions of known toxins, demonstrating their ability to bypass current defenses. This led to the creation and global dissemination of updated, more resilient screening software and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive dual-use research data, as detailed in their *Science* publication.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is expected to introduce a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers have concerns about its performance. While specific shortcomings weren't detailed, the new Siri is designed to offer advanced capabilities like on-screen awareness and personal context. Apple has several months until the anticipated March or April 2026 release to improve the voice assistant, though the feature has already faced prior delays, making its guaranteed launch uncertain.</h2>
