    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse technical documentation. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system excels at multimodal document parsing, eliminates reliance on potentially erroneous data sources, and performs multi-hop reasoning for complex queries, ultimately improving answer accuracy by 12% for Signify and showcasing strong generalization capabilities for other industries.</h2>
