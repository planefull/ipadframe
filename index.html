    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to information overload and difficulties for genetic professionals. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline genetic analysis workflows. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic efficiency and outcomes by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information from literature, fostering human-AI collaboration.</h2>

    <h1>Epic: Apple's Updated App Marketplace Install Process Proves 'Scare Screens' Deterred Users</h1>
    <h2>Epic Games claims Apple deliberately stifled competition for third-party app marketplaces in the EU through "deceptive design" and "scare screens." This accusation is supported by data showing that after Apple streamlined the installation process from 15 to 6 steps and removed warnings in iOS 18.6, user drop-offs for Epic Games Store installations dramatically fell from 65% to 25%. Despite these improvements, Epic asserts that Apple's policies remain anti-competitive, citing "junk fees" and "discriminatory policies," and also criticized Google for similar practices.</h2>
