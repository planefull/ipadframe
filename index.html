    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in delivering accurate and efficient answers to complex professional inquiries due to vast product data and diverse documentation formats. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, integrating the PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% by effectively parsing multimodal content, establishing a reliable knowledge loop from original documents, and performing multi-hop reasoning for complex questions, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities for various industries.</h2>
