    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, as they lack the ability for temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning across extensive visual data. This agent uses modality-specific tools and an iterative self-evaluation loop, significantly enhancing performance, explainability, and scalability for complex multimodal queries.</h2>
