    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to information overload, difficulties in collaborative data sharing, and the complexity of reanalyzing whole genome sequencing data. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to design a generative AI-based assistant to support these professionals' sensemaking tasks. The proposed AI tool aims to streamline diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>
