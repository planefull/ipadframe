    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style "red-teaming" approach, creating thousands of AI-rewritten toxic protein variants to test and subsequently "patch" these screening defenses, making them more resilient. This collaboration also pioneered a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive research data, demonstrating a proactive model for addressing dual-use AI risks and fostering responsible scientific disclosure in the evolving landscape of AI and biology.</h2>

    <h1>Samsung Reportedly Gives Up on Super Thin Smartphones Amid Low Sales</h1>
    <h2>Samsung has abruptly canceled the development of its planned Galaxy S26 Edge smartphone and discontinued the product line, less than five months after the Galaxy S25 Edge debuted to disappointing sales. The ultra-thin S25 Edge, which featured a slim profile but a reduced battery capacity and high price, failed to resonate with consumers, prompting Samsung to shift away from niche thin designs. The company will now revert to its traditional lineup with a Galaxy S26 Plus model, prioritizing broader consumer appeal and suggesting potential market challenges for similar devices like the iPhone Air.</h2>
