    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety of large language model (LLM)-based code agents, addressing the shortcomings of traditional static safety benchmarks that fail to assess real-world execution risks. This innovative framework utilizes an adaptive memory module, a specialized toolbox with code-specific attack simulations, and sandbox environments to continuously learn and optimize attack strategies. Consequently, RedCodeAgent consistently achieves higher attack success rates, lower rejection rates, and discovers previously unknown vulnerabilities across diverse programming languages and code agents, outperforming other leading jailbreak methods.</h2>

    <h1>M5 Ultra Chip Coming to Mac Studio in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to release an M5 Ultra chip in 2026, slated for updates to the Mac Studio and potentially the Mac Pro. This chip would likely follow the M5 Pro and Max variants, which are expected in early 2026. The M5 Ultra will mark a return for the high-end chip, as Apple skipped an M4 Ultra due to technical limitations and clarifies that it doesn't intend to create an Ultra variant for every M-series generation.</h2>
