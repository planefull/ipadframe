    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to its extensive and complex product documentation. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into its knowledge management system, built on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system, capable of understanding multimodal content, learning domain-specific reasoning, and performing multi-hop reasoning, successfully improved answer accuracy by 12% and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various industries.</h2>
