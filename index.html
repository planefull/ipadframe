    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex tasks involving long-form video and large image collections, as they lack temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement capabilities. To overcome these limitations, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This system, featuring modality-specific agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent, utilizes iterative tool-based reasoning and self-evaluation to enhance performance, providing explainable, extensible, and scalable solutions for complex visual queries.</h2>
