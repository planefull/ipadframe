    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing. The study identified challenges like information overload and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis, then co-designed an AI assistant to address these by synthesizing vast biomedical data and flagging cases for re-evaluation. This AI-driven approach aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency, reduce diagnosis time, and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with unsolved rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Skipped the iPhone 17 Pro? Here's What is Rumored for iPhone 18 Pro</h1>
    <h2>Early rumors for the iPhone 18 Pro models, still a year away, suggest a slightly smaller Dynamic Island and a "translucent" MagSafe area on the back, while largely retaining the current design and display sizes. A significant camera upgrade is rumored to include a variable aperture for the main 48-megapixel lens, offering greater control over depth of field. Additionally, the devices are expected to feature a more powerful A20 Pro chip built on a 2nm process and Apple's custom-designed C2 modem for improved performance and connectivity.</h2>
