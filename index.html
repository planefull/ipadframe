    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials like mobile driver's licenses or app logins to be tracked and linked to individuals. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose only necessary information without revealing underlying data or allowing their distinct digital interactions to be connected, and it works without requiring updates from credential-issuing organizations.</h2>
