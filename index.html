    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to know *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for extended periods. This approach significantly improves success rates for tasks lasting hours by optimizing checking frequency and preventing context overflow, and is available open-source as part of Magentic-UI.</h2>
