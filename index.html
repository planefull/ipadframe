    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, despite their convenience, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials (like mobile driver's licenses or app logins) to be tracked and profiled via hidden identifiers. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to existing identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using efficient zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing linking data or requiring issuing organizations to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3 Likely Available to Order Today According to Best Buy</h1>
    <h2>Hours before Apple's special event, Best Buy has seemingly indicated that AirPods Pro 3 will be available to order starting today. The retailer's website is offering a $20 reward for My Best Buy members for the unannounced headphones, with the offer becoming valid on September 9. This leak supports existing expectations that the AirPods Pro 3, rumored to include heart rate monitoring and design changes, would debut and be made available immediately after Apple's presentation.</h2>
