    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes because they lack the ability to intelligently "wait," often failing due to inefficient polling or context overflow. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform such tasks for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context effectively. Integrated into Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for long-duration monitoring, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
