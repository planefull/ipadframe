    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow over extended periods. Integrated into the Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly enhances agent reliability for longer tasks, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>YouTube Rolls Out AI Likeness Detection Tool to Prevent Deepfakes</h1>
    <h2>YouTube has launched a new AI likeness detection feature, allowing creators to identify and request the removal of unauthorized AI-generated videos that use or alter their facial likeness. This tool, found in YouTube Studio after an identity verification process, aims to safeguard creator identities and prevent audiences from being misled by deepfakes. The feature is rolling out to YouTube Partner Program members over the next few months, with all monetized creators expected to have access by January 2026.</h2>
