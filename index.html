    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and vast image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This agentic system, featuring modality-specific tools for images and videos, enables iterative reasoning, self-evaluation, and significant performance improvements on multimodal benchmarks, offering a scalable solution for complex visual question answering and analysis.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV Pluribus Star Rhea Seehorn to Answer Questions as Carol Sturka in Reddit AMA</h1>
    <h2>Apple is creatively promoting its new Apple TV series, "Pluribus," by having star Rhea Seehorn participate in an in-character "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) on Reddit. Seehorn will answer questions as Carol Sturka, the show's main character who is also a fictional author within the series. To further build interest, Apple has released an excerpt from Sturka's fictional book, "Bloodsong of Wycaro," in the Apple Books app, tying into the sci-fi thriller created by Vince Gilligan.</h2>
