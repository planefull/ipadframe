    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system. SentinelStep enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context, significantly improving reliability for tasks lasting hours or days and paving the way for more proactive AI assistants.</h2>
