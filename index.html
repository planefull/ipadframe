    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare genetic diseases. Whole genome sequencing analysis currently faces challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, leading to many unsolved cases. The research led to the co-design of an AI assistant prototype that flags cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizes vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>
