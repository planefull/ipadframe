    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article identifies "tool-space interference" as a growing challenge for agentic AI as diverse tools become horizontally integrated through protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This interference, observed through analyzing MCP servers, manifests as performance degradation due to high tool counts, excessively long responses, complex parameter schemas, naming conflicts, and inadequate error messages. To ensure agent compatibility and efficiency at scale, the authors recommend implementing formal namespaces, improving client-provided resource handling, transparent server documentation, client-side optimizations, and marketplace-driven best practices.</h2>
