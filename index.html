    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be connected and user behavior tracked. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for efficiency on mobile devices, to enable users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing linking information or requiring issuers to update their systems, thus significantly enhancing user privacy.</h2>
