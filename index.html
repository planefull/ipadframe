    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, a collaborative effort led by Microsoft Research, revealed that AI-powered tools can redesign toxic protein sequences in ways that evade existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a "zero-day" vulnerability. To address this, a cross-sector team developed more robust screening methods and "patches" that were then shared with global DNA synthesis companies to strengthen defenses against AI-enabled misuse. The project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>AT&T Website References Next-Generation iPad Pro With M5 Chip</h1>
    <h2>AT&T's website, specifically its Google search result title for its iPad page, briefly referenced an unreleased iPad Pro with an M5 chip, stating "iPad Pro M5 Pre-Order Soon." While there are no current product listings, this mention could be an accidental leak or a premature SEO move, signaling an upcoming update. This aligns with rumors that Apple is expected to announce new iPad Pro models with an M5 chip as early as this month.</h2>
