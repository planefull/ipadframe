    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but present privacy risks, particularly "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow various online activities to be tracked and associated with a single person. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses efficient zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing any linking data or requiring extensive changes to existing infrastructure.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly discounted the annual MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, offering it at $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, down from the regular $99. This reduced rate covers all live and on-demand matches through the playoffs, along with features like "MLS 360" and "Sunday Night Soccer." Consistent with previous years, the annual pass will automatically renew at the standard $99 price for the 2026 season unless canceled manually.</h2>
