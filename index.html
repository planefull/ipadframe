    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models face challenges in performing complex, real-world reasoning over long-form videos and extensive image collections due to limited context and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture to facilitate iterative, tool-based reasoning for both video and static image analysis. This system significantly enhances the performance of base models by providing structured ingestion, retrieval, and self-evaluation, delivering explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal question-answering capabilities.</h2>
