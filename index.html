    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form video and large image datasets, often failing to perform the complex temporal and cross-modal reasoning required for real-world scenarios. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning over vast visual data. This agent framework, which includes specialized VideoAgent and ImageAgent components, significantly improves performance by enabling tool-based analysis, self-evaluation, and refinement of conclusions for both long-form videos and static image collections.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Sees Record October in China With Strong iPhone 17 Demand</h1>
    <h2>Apple experienced a record-breaking October in China, with iPhone sales soaring 37% year-over-year thanks to robust demand for the new iPhone 17 models. This surge allowed Apple to capture a quarter of the Chinese smartphone market, a milestone not achieved since 2022, with the standard iPhone 17 leading growth among the new lineup. This strong performance, surpassing previous peaks, contributed significantly to an 8% overall growth in China's smartphone market and gives Apple strong momentum despite upcoming competition.</h2>
