    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This agentic framework uses modality-specific tools and iterative reasoning to significantly improve performance, enabling explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal question-answering across vast visual datasets.</h2>

    <h1>This Free App Unlocks AirPods Features on Android Devices</h1>
    <h2>A new free app called LibrePods significantly enhances AirPods' functionality on Android phones, unlocking features previously reserved for Apple devices like ear detection, Head Gestures, and Conversational Awareness. Developer Kavish Devar reverse-engineered Apple's protocols to make AirPods identify Android devices as iPhones, enabling access to these advanced features. While the app currently often requires a rooted Android phone, it supports all AirPods models and offers a more seamless listening experience for Android users.</h2>
