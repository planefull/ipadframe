    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form and large-scale visual data, lacking the temporal reasoning and iterative refinement needed for complex real-world analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based framework featuring a Planner-Critic architecture for structured reasoning over extensive video and image collections. This agent-based system, with specialized tools and an iterative feedback loop, significantly enhances performance and explainability in tasks requiring deep multimodal understanding, outperforming conventional models that provide one-shot answers.</h2>
