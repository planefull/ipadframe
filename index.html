    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is challenging for genetic professionals due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI-based assistant designed to support these professionals. This AI assistant aims to streamline analysis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26: Track Emailed Orders in Apple Wallet</h1>
    <h2>In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence significantly improves the Wallet app's order tracking feature, which was previously underused due to its reliance on merchant support. The new integration automatically scans users' emails for shipping details, allowing virtually any online purchase to be tracked within the Wallet app. This update makes the feature genuinely useful for consolidating purchase information, though it requires an iPhone 15 Pro or newer to access.</h2>
