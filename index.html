    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow featuring dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability for longer durations and has been open-sourced to enable the development of more practical, proactive, and persistent AI assistants.</h2>
