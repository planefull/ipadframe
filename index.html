    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or prices because they lack the ability to wait and check periodically without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. SentinelStep intelligently adjusts how often an agent checks and saves its state to prevent context overflow, demonstrably improving task success rates for monitoring tasks lasting hours or days.</h2>
