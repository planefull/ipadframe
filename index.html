    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is a novel, automated red-teaming agent developed by researchers to evaluate the safety and security risks of large language model-based code agents, which generate and execute code. Unlike traditional static benchmarks, RedCodeAgent uses an adaptive memory, a specialized toolbox with code-specific attack simulations, and a sandbox environment to dynamically learn and test for vulnerabilities through code execution. This system consistently achieves higher attack success rates, lower rejection rates, and uncovers previously unknown vulnerabilities across various programming languages and code agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying real-world security flaws.</h2>

    <h1>M5 Ultra Chip Coming to Mac Studio in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to release an M5 Ultra chip in 2026, intended for the Mac Studio and potentially a Mac Pro update, according to Bloomberg. This M5 Ultra would follow the M5 Pro and Max variants, which are expected in early 2026, potentially debuting in mid-to-late 2026. The company previously skipped an M4 Ultra due to technical limitations and clarifies that a high-end Ultra chip won't be made for every M-series generation.</h2>
