    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis, when using whole genome sequencing to diagnose rare genetic diseases, leading to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute conducted a study exploring how generative AI could enhance these workflows, co-designing a prototype AI assistant. This AI aims to streamline diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing complex gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time for patients with rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>What to Expect From Apple's Magic Mouse 3 After Logitech Announces MX Master 4</h1>
    <h2>Logitech recently announced the MX Master 4 mouse, which includes new features like haptic feedback, an "Actions Ring" for shortcuts, and a more durable finish, priced at $119.99. Following this, Apple is rumored to be planning a Magic Mouse 3, expected in 2026 at the earliest, with anticipated updates focusing on a relocated charging port and a more ergonomic design. While these changes would improve the Magic Mouse, the MX Master 4 is still presented as a more advanced option for power users.</h2>
