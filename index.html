    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers in credentials allow separate activities to be associated with a person, leading to tracking and profiling. Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats, such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs to ensure users can selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or allowing their interactions to be linked, all without requiring extensive changes to existing infrastructure.</h2>
