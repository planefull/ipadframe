    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over extensive visual data like long videos and large image collections, due to limited context and single-pass inference. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner-Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. This agent uses modality-specific tools for tasks like video ingestion and image analysis, allowing for explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal question-answering, significantly improving performance on benchmark datasets.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</h1>
    <h2>A Texas judge denied Apple and OpenAI's bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI, meaning the case will proceed. xAI accuses Apple and OpenAI of conspiring to dominate the AI market by exclusively integrating ChatGPT into Siri, thereby limiting user choice and harming competing AI products like Grok. The lawsuit claims this alleged anticompetitive scheme, prompted by Apple's "desperate bid" to protect its monopoly, prevents other generative AI chatbots from having similar functionality and integration with iOS.</h2>
