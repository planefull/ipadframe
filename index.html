    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>Code agents, while streamlining software development, pose significant safety and security risks that traditional static benchmarks fail to address effectively, particularly regarding code execution. To counter this, researchers developed RedCodeAgent, the first automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate large language model-based code agents. RedCodeAgent utilizes an adaptive memory, a specialized toolbox including code substitution, and simulated execution environments to achieve higher attack success rates, adapt its strategies based on task difficulty, and uncover new vulnerabilities across various programming languages and code agents.</h2>

    <h1>M5 Ultra Chip Coming to Mac Studio in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to debut an M5 Ultra chip in 2026, slated for the Mac Studio and potentially a Mac Pro update, as the company doesn't release an Ultra variant for every chip generation. Historically, Ultra chips, which fuse two Max chips using UltraFusion technology, follow the release of Pro and Max variants; the M5 Ultra is expected after the M5 Pro and M5 Max in mid-to-late 2026. This comes after Apple skipped an M4 Ultra due to the M4 Max lacking the necessary connector, and the M5 Ultra update for the Mac Studio is likely to focus on internal performance improvements.</h2>
