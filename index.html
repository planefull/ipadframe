    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing analysis. The research identified challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis, which limit diagnostic success for complex genetic conditions. By co-designing an AI assistant prototype, the study proposes solutions to flag cases for reanalysis and synthesize vast scientific literature, aiming to streamline workflows and improve diagnosis rates for patients with rare genetic diseases.</h2>
