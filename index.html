    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, needing capabilities like temporal understanding and iterative refinement beyond simple object recognition. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner-Critic architecture. This system uses modality-specific agents and an iterative reasoning loop with specialized tools to process complex queries across large visual datasets, leading to substantial improvements in accuracy and providing explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal understanding.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Settles With EPA After Hazardous Waste Violations at California Facility</h1>
    <h2>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Apple regarding hazardous waste management violations at its semiconductor facility in Santa Clara, California. An investigation, prompted by a complaint, revealed that Apple had improperly labeled hazardous waste containers and failed to control air emissions from a solvent waste tank. Apple has since resolved these issues, installed new equipment, achieved compliance, and paid a $261,283 penalty.</h2>
