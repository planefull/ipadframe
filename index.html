    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach enables agents to effectively monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving task reliability and paving the way for more practical, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Threads Now Supports Disappearing 'Ghost Posts' That Archive After 24 Hours</h1>
    <h2>Meta has introduced "Ghost posts" on its Threads social network, which are posts that automatically archive after a 24-hour period. These disappearing posts ensure that replies are sent directly to the user's inbox rather than appearing publicly, and they are visually distinct in the feed with a gray chat bubble. The feature aims to empower Threads users to share unfiltered thoughts without the pressure of permanence or polish.</h2>
