    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses "tool-space interference" within the rapidly expanding Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, where diverse AI agents and tools must interact. This horizontal integration introduces challenges such as large tool counts, excessive response lengths, complex parameter schemas, naming conflicts, and poor error handling, which collectively reduce agent effectiveness. To mitigate these issues, the authors recommend implementing formal namespaces, enhancing protocol support for client-provided resources, encouraging transparent server documentation, and applying client and marketplace optimizations for better compatibility and efficiency.</h2>

    <h1>'A New Story': Apple Store in Tokyo Returning to Original 2003 Location</h1>
    <h2>Apple Ginza is closing its temporary location and will soon reopen its store at its original Ginza 3-chōme site in Tokyo, more than three years after moving out. The original Sayegusa Building was demolished and rebuilt, with the new store anticipated to open in the second half of 2025 following the temporary store's closure on September 22. To celebrate this return to its historic spot—Apple's first retail location outside the U.S. opened in 2003—the company has released a special commemorative wallpaper.</h2>
