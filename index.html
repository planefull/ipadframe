    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Research, uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, raising concerns about engineered biological threats. In response, a cross-sector team developed a "red-teaming" approach to identify and fix these loopholes, resulting in more robust screening methods that were subsequently shared globally. This initiative not only strengthened nucleic acid biosecurity but also pioneered a new "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive scientific data, balancing open science with the urgent need to mitigate information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>
