    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is highly challenging due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to information overload, collaboration difficulties, and inefficient reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to support genetic professionals in their sensemaking tasks. This AI tool is envisioned to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize critical gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to increase diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis times through enhanced human-AI collaboration.</h2>
