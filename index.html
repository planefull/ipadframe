    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they don't know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days using dynamic polling and efficient context management. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability over extended durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
