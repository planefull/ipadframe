    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data synthesis, when analyzing whole genome sequencing data to diagnose rare genetic diseases, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, a collaboration including Microsoft Research developed a generative AI assistant prototype designed to streamline these processes. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis times by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing critical gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2, and tvOS 18.6, which means users can no longer downgrade to these older operating system versions if they've upgraded to iOS 26. This action, a week after iOS 26's release, prevents the installation of outdated and less secure software. Consequently, once a device is upgraded to iOS 26, there is no option to revert to iOS 18.</h2>
