    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage when to check, leading to resource waste or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system that enables agents to perform these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and carefully managing context. This approach significantly improves the reliability of agents on longer monitoring tasks, making them more patient and efficient, and is now open-sourced for broader implementation.</h2>
