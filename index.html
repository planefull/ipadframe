    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, including information overload and complex data synthesis, leading to low diagnosis rates and prolonged patient suffering. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively studied these obstacles and co-designed a generative AI assistant prototype. This AI tool aims to enhance genetic professionals' workflows by flagging unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information from scientific literature, ultimately improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>New MacBook Pro models, featuring M5 chips, are reportedly nearing mass production and are expected to launch between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, according to Mark Gurman. However, more significant upgrades are anticipated in late 2026, including an OLED display, touch screen, thinner design, and M6 chips with a 2nm process. Additionally, these later models are rumored to potentially include cellular connectivity and a smaller display notch.</h2>
