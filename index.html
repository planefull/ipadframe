    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in connected LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers from its extensive, complex, and multimodal product documentation to professional users. To overcome this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, eliminating reliance on erroneous data sources, and performing dynamic task decomposition with multi-hop reasoning for complex queries.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, New York, is scheduled to reopen on Friday, November 21, after extensive renovations. The updated store will feature a modern design, incorporating more wood paneling instead of stainless steel. This reopening is part of a larger trend, as Apple is currently renovating several other U.S. stores and recently completed similar projects in Texas and Australia.</h2>
