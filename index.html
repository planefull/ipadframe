    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs and optimized for mobile devices, Crescent allows users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, all without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly discounted the MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, now offering the annual subscription for $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, a steep drop from its regular $99 price. This reduced rate covers all live and on-demand matches, playoffs, and features like "MLS 360" for the rest of the current season. While monthly subscriptions remain unchanged, users should be aware that the discounted annual pass will automatically renew at the standard $99 price for the 2026 season unless manually canceled.</h2>
