    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," discussed on the Microsoft Research Podcast, uncovered how AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins, like ricin, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, IBBIS, and Twist Bioscience, developed and implemented AI-resilient screening solutions to patch these vulnerabilities, sharing them globally to enhance biosecurity. This collaborative effort not only strengthened defenses against emerging AI-enabled biological threats but also established a novel framework for responsible disclosure and ongoing engagement with dual-use research.</h2>
