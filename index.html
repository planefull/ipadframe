    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI," which investigated where generative AI chatbots, like Bing Copilot, could be most useful across different occupations, finding them particularly applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks. The study explicitly concluded that AI serves as a tool to assist with specific subtasks, rather than indicating that entire jobs will be eliminated. The authors emphasized the research's limitations, noting that job roles involve more than just tasks and that the findings do not suggest job displacement, advocating instead for using AI to complement human strengths.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Music Transfer Tool for Switching From Spotify Now Available in UK and 7 Other Countries</h1>
    <h2>Apple has expanded its music transfer tool to six additional countries, allowing users to import playlists and libraries from competing streaming services like Spotify directly into Apple Music. This feature, which initially launched in Australia and New Zealand, is now also available in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Users can initiate these transfers through the Apple Music app settings or its website, leveraging a partnership with SongShift to migrate their saved music and user-created playlists.</h2>
