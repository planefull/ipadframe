    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and difficulties prioritizing case reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline genetic analysis. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information from literature, ultimately enhancing patient quality of life.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Teardown Reveals Apple's New Approach to Thermal Management and Repairs</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the iPhone 17 Pro reveals a new vapor chamber cooling system that effectively manages heat from the A19 Pro chip, keeping the device significantly cooler than previous models. While the battery is easier to replace thanks to being secured by screws in a tray, the overall design is less repairable than the iPhone 16 Pro, as many components now require front-entry access. Despite some drawbacks, like a scratch-prone camera plateau and the removal of the dual-entry design, the iPhone 17 Pro received a repairability score of 7 out of 10.</h2>
