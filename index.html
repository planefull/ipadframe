    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring tasks, allowing them to remain proactive without wasting resources, and is now open-sourced as part of Magentic-UI.</h2>
