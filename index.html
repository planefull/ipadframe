    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, like watching for email responses or price drops, because they lack the ability to wait and poll effectively without wasting resources or prematurely giving up. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and carefully managing context. This innovation, open-sourced as part of Magentic-UI, significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks and lays the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.1 Beta Liquid Glass Battery Drain Test: Tinted vs Clear Mode</h1>
    <h2>This article investigates whether new iOS 26.1 Liquid Glass transparency settings, such as "Tinted" mode or accessibility features like Reduce Transparency, impact iPhone battery life. The author conducted multiple 2.5-hour tests on an iPhone 17 Pro Max, performing identical tasks with various Liquid Glass and accessibility settings enabled. The tests revealed no meaningful difference in battery consumption across any configurations, concluding that these settings are for visual preference rather than saving battery on modern iPhones.</h2>
