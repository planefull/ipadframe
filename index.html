    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner–Critic architecture designed for structured reasoning across diverse visual data. This agentic framework utilizes modality-specific tools and an iterative feedback loop to significantly enhance performance, explainability, and scalability for tasks requiring deep analysis of complex visual information.</h2>
