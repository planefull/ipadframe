    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Existing LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for hours or days efficiently. Integrated into the open-source Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and resource-aware autonomous assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV 4K Could Still Launch Before 2025 Ends: All the Rumored Features</h1>
    <h2>Apple is rumored to be releasing an updated Apple TV 4K within the next few months, though a major design overhaul is not expected. The primary upgrade will be a new A-series chip, potentially the A17 Pro, which will significantly boost performance for console-quality games and enable Apple Intelligence-powered Siri. Additionally, the new model is expected to feature Wi-Fi 7 support via a custom N1 chip, run tvOS 26, and could potentially offer a more affordable entry-level option.</h2>
