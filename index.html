    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or emails because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and poll, leading to resource waste or failure. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, making them more practical for real-world proactive tasks.</h2>
