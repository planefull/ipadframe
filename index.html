    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the massive amount of data from whole genome sequencing and significant information overload for genetic professionals. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed a generative AI-based assistant to aid these professionals in synthesizing complex biomedical data. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and aggregating scientific literature, ultimately increasing diagnostic rates and improving patient outcomes for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Two Weeks With the iPhone Air: Is Ultra-Thin Worth the Compromises?</h1>
    <h2>The iPhone Air features a significantly thinner and lighter design, making it exceptionally comfortable to hold and use, with improved durability thanks to its titanium frame. However, this sleek form factor comes with notable compromises, including a single-lens camera lacking advanced features, a smaller battery, potential heating and throttling issues, and a smudge-prone matte black finish. Priced at $999, the iPhone Air prioritizes an ultra-thin experience over maximum functionality, requiring users to weigh its ergonomic benefits against sacrifices in camera versatility, battery life, and performance.</h2>
