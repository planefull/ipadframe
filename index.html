    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in connected LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to a vast array of complex product data and diverse documentation formats. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by effectively parsing multimodal documents, creating an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex questions, demonstrating its strong generalization capabilities across industrial scenarios.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Cheap MacBook: What to Expect in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release a new low-cost MacBook in 2026, aiming to compete with affordable Chromebooks and Windows PCs at a price point well below the current $999 MacBook Air. This new model is rumored to feature a 13-inch LCD display and be powered by Apple's A18 Pro chip, offering performance comparable to or better than the M1 chip for day-to-day tasks. Designed for lightweight use like web browsing and document editing, it will also support Apple Intelligence and potentially come in bright colors, providing a macOS alternative to low-cost iPads.</h2>
