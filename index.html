    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task abandonment. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow that dynamically adjusts polling frequency and manages context to prevent overflow over hours or days. Integrated into the Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
