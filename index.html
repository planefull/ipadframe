    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. In response, the team developed an AI biosecurity "red-teaming" approach to identify such vulnerabilities and then created and shared "patches"—more robust protein screening systems—with DNA synthesis companies worldwide. This collaborative effort, detailed in *Science*, established a new model for managing information hazards through perpetual gatekeeping and demonstrated a proactive approach to strengthening global biosecurity against the dual-use risks of advancing AI capabilities in synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>AT&T Website References Next-Generation iPad Pro With M5 Chip</h1>
    <h2>AT&T's website briefly referenced an unreleased iPad Pro model featuring an M5 chip in its Google search results, prompting speculation about an accidental leak or premature SEO optimization. While there's no current product listing on their site, this aligns with rumors of Apple soon announcing the next iPad Pro models. The new iPad Pro, expected as early as this month, is not anticipated to have major design changes, though it has already appeared in early unboxing videos.</h2>
