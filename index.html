    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form video and large image datasets, requiring advanced temporal and cross-modal reasoning beyond current capabilities. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This agent uses modality-specific tools and iterative refinement to analyze complex visual data, offering explainable, extensible, and scalable solutions that significantly enhance base model performance.</h2>
