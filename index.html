    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for hours or days without failure. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability for longer durations and is open-sourced for developers to build more patient and proactive agents.</h2>

    <h1>Withings Launches iPhone-Connected Urine Reader That Goes in Your Toilet</h1>
    <h2>Withings has launched its U-Scan, a toilet-mounted health sensor that automatically analyzes urine samples, in the U.S. and Europe after a two-year delay. The compact device offers interchangeable cartridges like Nutrio for nutrition and hydration indicators, and Calci for tracking calcium levels, with each providing about 22 tests over three months. Positioned as a "wellness product" to bypass FDA clearance, the U-Scan is available starting at $349.95, aiming to integrate passive health tracking into daily routines.</h2>
