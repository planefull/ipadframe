    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to context limitations and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner-Critic architecture that enables iterative, tool-based reasoning across various visual modalities. This agent framework significantly enhances base model performance on benchmarks for both video and image analysis, providing an explainable, extensible, and scalable solution for complex visual reasoning tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Europe Wants to Cut Down on Annoying GDPR Cookie Pop-Ups</h1>
    <h2>The European Commission has announced a new digital package that relaxes some rules previously established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Key changes include modernizing cookie rules to reduce pop-ups through browser-level consent and allowing personal data use for AI training without express consent, alongside simplifying cybersecurity reporting and delaying parts of the AI Act. Critics, however, warn that these changes risk watering down consumer protections and undermining fundamental digital rights in the EU.</h2>
