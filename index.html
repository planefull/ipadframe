    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex, long-form visual data and large libraries, requiring more than single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen's Planner–Critic architecture. This agent uses specialized tools and iterative reasoning across both image and video data, significantly enhancing performance on benchmarks and providing explainable, extensible, and scalable insights for real-world reasoning.</h2>
