    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is a complex and time-consuming process for genetic professionals, often resulting in undiagnosed cases due to vast data volumes and information overload in whole genome sequencing. To address these challenges, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated on a study designing a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals' "sensemaking" tasks. This AI assistant aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic rates and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app, allowing them to use a digital ID on their iPhone and Apple Watch. This feature, expected to launch within the next month, can be used at select U.S. airports and for age verification, though it requires a $5 fee. While a convenient option, users should continue to carry their physical IDs as the digital version is not accepted everywhere, and North Dakota joins a growing list of states supporting this Apple Wallet functionality.</h2>
