    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research's paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," explored how AI chatbots might be useful across different occupations. The study found AI to be most applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks like writing and information gathering, suggesting it can assist in existing workflows. However, the authors explicitly caution against interpreting their findings as predicting job elimination, emphasizing that the research does not support such conclusions due to methodological limitations and the complex nature of occupations.</h2>

    <h1>From iPhone 17 Air to iPhone 20: Apple's Redesign Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning a complete overhaul of the iPhone's design over the next three years, leading up to a radically different "iPhone 20" for its 20th anniversary in 2027. In 2025, the company will introduce the much thinner iPhone 17 Air, followed by the first foldable iPhone in 2026, which will feature both external and internal displays. The ultimate goal for 2027 is an all-glass iPhone with a wraparound, bezel-free display that curves around all edges.</h2>
