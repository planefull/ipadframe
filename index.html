    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form video and large image datasets, lacking the temporal reasoning and iterative refinement needed for complex real-world tasks. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system uses modality-specific agents and an iterative reasoning loop to decompose complex queries, select appropriate tools, and refine answers for accuracy across extensive visual and textual data, significantly outperforming base models on benchmarks.</h2>

    <h1>Google Launches More Intelligent Gemini 3 Model</h1>
    <h2>Google has launched Gemini 3 Pro, its newest and most intelligent AI model, which Google claims offers state-of-the-art reasoning and is the best in the world for multimodal understanding. This model excels at understanding depth, nuance, context, and intent, outperforming previous versions on major AI benchmarks by providing concise and direct responses. Gemini 3 Pro is rolling out across various Google platforms, including a redesigned Gemini app and AI Mode in Search, with an even more intelligent "Deep Think" version for Ultra subscribers coming soon.</h2>
