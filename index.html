    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to address the limitations of existing multimodal AI in analyzing long-form video and large image collections. Built on AutoGen, this framework uses a Planner–Critic architecture to enable structured, iterative reasoning through modality-specific agents and tools. MMCTAgent significantly enhances performance on complex visual reasoning tasks by decomposing queries, evaluating intermediate results, and refining answers for factual accuracy and consistency across extensive datasets.</h2>

    <h1>12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple's 2026 Budget Tablet</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to update its affordable iPad with a 12th-generation model in spring 2026, though it's not expected to feature a major design overhaul and will likely retain its current 11-inch display. However, significant internal upgrades are anticipated, including a new A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and an N1 chip enabling Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. The 12th-generation iPad is expected to maintain its current pricing, starting at $349, with no changes to cameras or accessory compatibility.</h2>
