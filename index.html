    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address challenges faced by genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. They found that professionals struggle with information overload, collaborative sharing, and prioritizing case reanalysis due to the vast and complex data involved. The study co-designed a generative AI assistant prototype to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing scientific literature, aiming to increase diagnostic rates and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, which means users who have upgraded to iOS 26 can no longer downgrade to the older version. This "unsigning" process prevents the installation of outdated, less secure software by blocking Apple's server-side verification check. While users aren't forced to upgrade, once on iOS 26 (or iPadOS/tvOS equivalents), a downgrade is now impossible.</h2>
