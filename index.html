    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast "Ideas" highlights the "Paraphrase Project," a collaborative effort that uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers demonstrated that AI could "paraphrase" dangerous protein sequences, making them undetectable by current safeguards used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, the team developed and implemented patches to strengthen these screening systems, alongside pioneering a new "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing to address information hazards in dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses with an in-lens display are rumored to feature two distinct operating modes. According to Mark Gurman, they could run a full version of visionOS when connected to a Mac and a more lightweight, mobile-friendly interface when paired with an iPhone. While the first generation, expected around 2026-2027, will lack an in-lens display but offer features like cameras and speakers, this two-mode system would significantly enhance future models.</h2>
