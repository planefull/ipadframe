    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to evade current biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, developed a "red-teaming" pipeline to generate these AI-rewritten proteins and subsequently created and deployed robust "patches" to strengthen global biosecurity screening. This effort not only enhanced defenses against AI-enabled biological threats but also established a novel, perpetually gatekept system for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, addressing the dual-use dilemma in science.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses, featuring an in-lens display, are rumored to offer two distinct operating modes: a full visionOS experience when paired with a Mac and a more lightweight interface when connected to an iPhone. The first-generation glasses, expected to be announced as early as 2026 for a 2027 launch, will include speakers, cameras, voice control, and potential health features but will not have an in-lens display. These glasses will compete with devices like Meta Ray-Bans, which currently offer an in-lens display.</h2>
