    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose privacy risks, specifically "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate credential uses to create detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that brings "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes optimized zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information and prove facts without revealing any data that could link their digital interactions, and works without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Loses Robotics AI Researcher to Meta</h1>
    <h2>Apple's lead AI researcher for robotics, Jian Zhang, has left for Meta, joining a growing list of at least a dozen AI experts who have departed Apple for competitors like Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic since January. These high-profile exits are largely due to massive pay packages offered by companies like Meta, which Apple has reportedly been unable to match. This talent drain is fueling a "crisis of confidence" in Apple's AI future, compounded by product delays and internal tensions as the company considers third-party solutions for Siri's AI capabilities.</h2>
