    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know when to re-check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete persistent monitoring by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and efficient always-on AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>Sam Sung, an Apple retail employee, went viral in 2012 due to his name's similarity to competitor Samsung, causing him anxiety and leading Apple to remove him from the store floor. He eventually left Apple, auctioning off memorabilia for charity in 2014. To escape being an "internet joke," Sung later changed his last name to Struan, though he now wishes his younger self had taken the situation less seriously.</h2>
