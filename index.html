    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to monitor conditions for extended periods. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants capable of anticipating and adapting to real-world needs.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are reporting a problem with a static-like or "ocean" sound when Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Adaptive, or Transparency modes are active, especially without media playing. This audible hiss or white noise can vary in intensity, sometimes being worse in one ear or amplifying high frequencies, making low-level music listening difficult for some. While some users have received replacements from Apple, others experience the same issue with new units, and it's unclear if the problem is hardware or software-related.</h2>
