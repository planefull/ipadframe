    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring activities due to their inability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over time. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This enables agents to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving reliability for long-running tasks like tracking emails or price changes, and is open-sourced as part of Magentic-UI.</h2>
