    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track users' activities across different applications. Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses, preventing credentials from being linked to a specific person or activity. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs with a two-stage process for efficient mobile device use, allowing users to selectively disclose information without revealing identifying data or requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Lifts Smartphone Market Shipments as Rivals Stall</h1>
    <h2>Apple's iPhone shipments are projected to grow by nearly 4% in 2025, becoming the main catalyst for a 1% increase in the global smartphone market, which would otherwise be stagnant or decline. This resilience is driven by strong customer loyalty, effective trade-in offers, and installment plans, contrasting with weaker Android sales. The overall industry is also seeing a focus on premiumization and rising average selling prices, with iPhone sales in the U.S. significantly influenced by major carriers and their promotional activities.</h2>
