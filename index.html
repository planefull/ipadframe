    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions over hours or days. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and carefully managing agent context to prevent overflow, significantly improving success rates for extended tasks and laying the groundwork for more practical and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
