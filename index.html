    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is challenging due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and complex reanalysis of unsolved cases, leading to prolonged patient suffering. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals in interpreting vast amounts of data. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Blames In-Store MagSafe Chargers for iPhone 17 Pro Display Model Scratches</h1>
    <h2>Apple confirmed that marks appearing on iPhone 17 Pro display models in retail stores are due to material transfer from worn MagSafe charging stands, not scratches. These marks are removable with cleaning, and Apple plans to fix the issue in stores, noting that other iPhone models are also affected. Separately, scratch tests indicate the iPhone 17 Pro camera plateau is prone to scratching, which Apple considers normal wear and tear despite its design for durability.</h2>
