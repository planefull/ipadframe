    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex, long-form video and large image collections, lacking the necessary temporal reasoning and iterative processing for real-world visual data. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system available on GitHub and Azure AI Foundry Labs. MMCTAgent uses a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized agents for images and videos, employing iterative reasoning and an extensible toolchain to significantly improve accuracy, explainability, and scalability for complex visual analysis.</h2>

    <h1>12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple's 2026 Budget Tablet</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to release a 12th-generation low-cost iPad in spring 2026, which is expected to retain its current design but feature substantial internal upgrades. The tablet will be powered by an A18 chip, bringing Apple Intelligence support and improved performance, likely requiring an upgrade to 8GB of RAM. It will also reportedly include the N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, potentially an Apple-designed cellular modem, and is expected to maintain its $349 starting price.</h2>
