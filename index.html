    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex technical questions due to vast product data, multimodal documents, and intricate parameters. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This specialized RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% through multimodal document parsing, eliminating reliance on erroneous data sources, and employing dynamic task decomposition with multi-hop reasoning, enhancing overall customer service and demonstrating its broad applicability across industries.</h2>
