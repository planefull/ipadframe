    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The proliferation of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is creating a "society of tools," allowing diverse AI agents to integrate horizontally and extend their capabilities significantly. However, this expansion introduces "tool-space interference," leading to issues such as performance degradation, increased costs, and task failures due to challenges like excessive tool counts, overly long responses, complex parameters, naming conflicts, and poor error handling. To address these problems, the article proposes recommendations for protocol developers (e.g., formal namespaces), server developers (e.g., publishing server cards), client developers (e.g., context management), and market developers (e.g., optimized tool schemas) to foster a more reliable and efficient ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Liquid Glass Design Makes App Icons Look Crooked, Report Users</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26's new Liquid Glass interface is reportedly causing app icons to appear tilted for some users, in addition to existing criticisms of content illegibility. This optical illusion, created by subtle glowing effects on icon corners, makes affected users feel disoriented, dizzy, and even "drunk." The issue is most pronounced in dark display modes on dark backgrounds, and current accessibility settings do not mitigate the effect, leading to hopes for a future dedicated fix from Apple.</h2>
