    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," which allows tracking of user activities across different credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs with a two-stage process, enabling users to selectively disclose information and prevent their digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Refurbished Apple Pencil Pro Now Available in U.S. at a Discount</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Pencil Pro is now available for the first time in Apple's online refurbished stores in the U.S. and Canada, just months after its May 2024 launch. In the U.S., it's priced at $109, offering about a 15% discount, though a new one can be found on Amazon for only $1.87 more, making the refurbished savings minimal. Despite Apple's rigorous refurbishment process ensuring like-new condition, the article suggests the refurbished option might not be the best value currently compared to buying new.</h2>
