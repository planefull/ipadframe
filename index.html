    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email or price drop, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to perform these tasks effectively. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow, allowing agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods and significantly improving task success rates for longer durations.</h2>

    <h1>Report: 'Virtually No Demand' for iPhone Air</h1>
    <h2>Apple is drastically cutting production of the iPhone Air due to weaker-than-expected consumer interest and low demand across various markets, despite initial sell-outs in China. The company is now shifting its focus and increasing production for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models, which show healthier demand, particularly for the Pro versions. Surveys confirm "virtually no demand" for the iPhone Air, with limited consumer willingness to pay for a foldable device and AI features not yet meaningfully influencing purchasing decisions.</h2>
