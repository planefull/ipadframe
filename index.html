    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass current biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research and industry partners, developed robust "patches" and improved screening methods to detect these AI-generated variants. This effort not only strengthened biosecurity in nucleic acid synthesis but also established a new model for responsible disclosure of dual-use research, highlighting the critical need for ongoing vigilance and collaboration in managing AI risks in biotechnology.</h2>

    <h1>New iPad Pro Has Six Key Upgrades Beyond M5 Chip</h1>
    <h2>The new iPad Pro, powered by the M5 chip, delivers significantly faster CPU and GPU performance, with core counts and RAM varying by storage configuration. Beyond the M5, it introduces custom N1 and C1X chips for enhanced Wi-Fi 7/Bluetooth 6 connectivity and up to 50% faster cellular data, respectively. Other key upgrades include up to 2x faster SSD speeds, 120Hz external display support with Adaptive Sync, fast charging capabilities, and an ultra-low 1 nit display brightness.</h2>
