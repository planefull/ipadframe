    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling a "society of agents" by allowing diverse AI tools from various developers to integrate horizontally, moving beyond traditional vertically integrated AI systems. However, this horizontal integration introduces "tool-space interference," causing issues such as agents struggling with high tool counts, excessively long responses, complex parameters, naming conflicts, and unhelpful error messages, which collectively reduce end-to-end effectiveness. To mitigate these challenges, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, enhancing client-provided resource sharing, encouraging transparent server documentation, and developing client-side optimizations and marketplace solutions to ensure robust interoperability and scalability.</h2>
