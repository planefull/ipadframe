    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>Current safety evaluations for AI code agents are inadequate for detecting real-world security risks, particularly those involving code execution and combined jailbreak methods. To address this, researchers introduced RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety of LLM-based code agents. RedCodeAgent leverages a memory module, a specialized toolbox, and simulated execution environments to achieve higher attack success rates, uncover new vulnerabilities across diverse code agents and programming languages, and adapt its strategies effectively.</h2>

    <h1>M5 Ultra Chip Coming to Mac Studio in 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to debut an M5 Ultra chip in 2026 for the Mac Studio and potentially a Mac Pro update, according to Bloomberg. This comes after the company decided against an M4 Ultra, as the M4 Max lacked the necessary UltraFusion connector to merge two chips. The M5 Ultra is expected to arrive after the M5 Pro and Max variants, possibly in June or September 2026, likely focusing on internal performance upgrades for the Mac Studio.</h2>
