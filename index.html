    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate credential uses to build detailed user profiles, even with existing selective disclosure features. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that brings "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or linking their interactions, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Has Smaller Dynamic Island, Claims Last-Minute Rumor</h1>
    <h2>A last-minute rumor suggests the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a redesigned, smaller Dynamic Island, shrinking the pill-shaped cutout by using a more compact camera and sensor system. This claim, originating from a previously unknown source and viewed with skepticism, adds to a history of persistent but conflicting rumors regarding the Dynamic Island's size reduction. While some reports anticipated this change, others suggested it might be delayed or not happen, with official details expected at Apple's event next week.</h2>
