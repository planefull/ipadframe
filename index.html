    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in efficiently providing accurate technical answers from its vast and complex product documentation to professional users. To improve this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate their advanced PIKE-RAG technology into its Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This specialized RAG system, which excels at multimodal document parsing, multi-hop reasoning, and domain adaptation, led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy for Signify, highlighting its potential for generalization across various industries.</h2>

This laptop is expected to feature a 13-inch LCD display, be powered by an A18 Pro chip (offering performance comparable to the M1), and support Apple Intelligence. While the exact price is unconfirmed, it's anticipated to be well under $1,000, potentially between $499 and $799, making it suitable for everyday tasks like browsing and document editing.</h2>
