    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and check at appropriate intervals. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to effectively monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents on longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
