    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to context limitations and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture. This agent iteratively employs modality-specific tools (e.g., ImageAgent, VideoAgent) to plan, reflect, and refine answers, significantly enhancing performance, explainability, and scalability for complex visual reasoning tasks.</h2>
