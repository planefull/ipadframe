    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. This "zero day" finding led to a cybersecurity-style response, developing and implementing more robust protein screening systems now shared globally to strengthen defenses. The project also introduced a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data and software sharing, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards in the evolving landscape of AI and biosecurity.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is set to introduce a revamped Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, promising features like on-screen awareness and personal context. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers have "concerns" about the overhauled Siri's performance. Apple has until the anticipated March or April release of iOS 26.4 to address these lingering issues, following a prior delay of the new Siri features.</h2>
