    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex technical questions due to its vast and multimodal product documentation. To overcome this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries.</h2>
