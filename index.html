    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where generative AI tools could design toxic proteins capable of bypassing existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to demonstrate this risk and then created a more robust, AI-resilient protein screening system, akin to a cybersecurity patch, which was shared globally. This collaborative effort not only strengthened biosecurity but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data and software sharing in dual-use research, balancing open science with mitigating information hazards.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store Near Sydney Reopens With All-New Design Later This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's retail store at Chatswood Chase in Australia is scheduled to reopen on Thursday, October 30, at 9:30 a.m. local time, following extensive renovations since July 2024. The redesigned store will feature an all-new look and updated amenities, including a dedicated Apple Pickup station for online orders. This reopening occurs during a potentially busy period for Apple, coinciding with anticipated new product releases and the company's Q4 FY 2025 earnings call, and also follows the recent permanent closure of Apple's nearby Hornsby store.</h2>
