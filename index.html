    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, primarily due to information overload and the complex, time-consuming nature of data analysis and reanalysis, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI-based assistant designed to enhance "sensemaking" in genetic workflows. This AI assistant aims to streamline processes by synthesizing vast biomedical data and flagging unsolved cases for reanalysis, ultimately seeking to improve diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis times for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>8GB iPad Prototype from 2011 Reveals Apple's Scrapped Budget Model</h1>
    <h2>AppleDemoYT recently revealed a rare prototype of a second-generation iPad from 2011, which featured only 8GB of storage and ran Apple's internal factory testing software, SwitchBoard. This Engineering Validation Testing (EVT) stage device confirms earlier rumors that Apple considered releasing a low-cost 8GB iPad model. However, Apple ultimately decided against it, never releasing an iPad with less than 16GB of storage, likely deeming 8GB insufficient for a tablet experience.</h2>
