    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" identified a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade existing screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed and shared "patches" to enhance these protein screening systems globally, effectively addressing this "zero day" threat. This collaborative effort also pioneered a new model for responsible disclosure of AI-related biosecurity risks, including perpetual gatekeeping for sensitive data, to guide future responses to dual-use technology dilemmas.</h2>
