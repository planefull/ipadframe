    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and lengthy reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, co-designed a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline diagnosis by helping genetic professionals synthesize information, flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and facilitate collaborative sensemaking, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and shortening diagnosis time for patients.</h2>
