    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Existing LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods, leading to failure or wasted resources. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow featuring dynamic polling adjustments and efficient context management. Implemented in Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly enhances agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>M4 vs. M5 iPad Pro Buyer's Guide: 20 Differences Compared</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new M5 iPad Pro, launched a year after the M4 model, offers iterative updates primarily centered on the new M5 chip and improved connectivity. While the M5 chip boasts significant performance gains, faster SSD speeds, increased baseline memory, and enhanced external display support, these benefits are largely limited to niche, high-end AI-driven workloads or professional use cases. Therefore, the M5 is primarily recommended for users upgrading from older iPads or those needing extensive future-proofing for demanding tasks, rather than M4 owners who will find little general-purpose reason to upgrade.</h2>
