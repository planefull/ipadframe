    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form and large-scale visual data, lacking the temporal and strategic reasoning capabilities needed for real-world scenarios. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system that uses a Planner–Critic architecture for structured, iterative reasoning over extensive video and image collections. This design enables MMCTAgent to leverage modality-specific tools and refine answers, significantly enhancing accuracy and providing explainable insights compared to traditional single-pass models.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iPad Air With M3 Chip at a Discount</h1>
    <h2>Apple has recently made iPad Air models with the M3 chip available in its refurbished stores in the United States and several European countries, marking their first appearance since the device's release in March. These refurbished models offer approximately a 15% discount compared to new prices, with an 11-inch M3 iPad Air (128GB, Wi-Fi) for example, priced at $509 instead of $599. All refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, come with accessories, and are backed by Apple's one-year warranty, ensuring a like-new condition after thorough inspection.</h2>
