    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the immense volume and complexity of whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address these issues, a collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored integrating generative AI to assist professionals with complex "sensemaking" tasks. The research identified key obstacles like information overload and proposed an AI assistant prototype to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare diseases.</h2>
