    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, such as information overload and complex data synthesis. They identified key obstacles and proposed AI-driven solutions to enhance workflows, aiming to improve diagnostic outcomes for patients. The study led to the design of an AI assistant prototype intended to streamline tasks like prioritizing cases for reanalysis and aggregating scientific literature on genes and variants, ultimately reducing diagnosis time and increasing diagnostic yield.</h2>

    <h1>Opera's Agentic AI Browser Neon Launches With Subscription Model</h1>
    <h2>Opera has launched Neon, a new subscription-based, AI-focused browser designed for "agentic browsing" that executes tasks directly within the browser. Available for $19.99/month, Neon aims to go beyond traditional browsing by using AI to open/close tabs, compare information, and complete transactions. It features "Tasks" for managing projects in separate workspaces, "Cards" for automating workflows, and a local "Neon Do" function that navigates websites and fills forms while keeping user data private.</h2>
