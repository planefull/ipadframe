    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI agentic system. SentinelStep enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and carefully managing context to prevent overflow, significantly improving task reliability over hours or days.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Apple to Skip 'iPhone 19' Name for 'iPhone 20'</h1>
    <h2>According to research firm Omdia, Apple is expected to skip the "iPhone 19" name, directly launching "iPhone 20" models in the second half of 2027 as part of a brand reset for the device's 20th anniversary. Apple plans to adopt a new biannual launch strategy in 2027, releasing standard "e" and regular models in the first half, followed by high-end devices like the iPhone Air, Pro models, and a foldable iPhone in the second half. This strategic shift aims to sustain sales throughout the year and revitalize the product lineup, despite an anticipated temporary reduction in iPhone panel orders in 2026 due to the revised schedule.</h2>
