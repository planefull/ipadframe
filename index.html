    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling a "society of tools" for AI agents, shifting from vertically integrated systems to broad horizontal integration that expands agent capabilities. However, this decentralized approach introduces "tool-space interference," manifesting as excessive tool counts, long responses, complex parameters, naming ambiguities, and poor error messages, all of which hinder agent effectiveness. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends formal namespaces, improved client-provided resource handling in the MCP, transparent server documentation, and client-side optimizations for a more robust and scalable AI agent ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store Near Sydney Permanently Closing Next Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's store at Westfield Hornsby in Australia will permanently close on October 4th, after operating since 2011. The closure is primarily due to Apple not renewing its lease, coinciding with the expanded reopening of its nearby Chatswood Chase store, which will feature new amenities like an Apple Pickup station. All affected retail employees from the Hornsby store will be offered opportunities to work at the redesigned Chatswood Chase location.</h2>
