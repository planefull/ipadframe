    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," which was misinterpreted as predicting job elimination. The original research found that AI chatbots are most useful for knowledge-based tasks like writing and information gathering, helping with subtasks in certain occupations. The authors emphasize that the study identifies where AI can assist workflows, not replace entire jobs, and caution against over-interpreting findings due to methodological limitations.</h2>
