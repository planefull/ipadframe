    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track users across various online activities. To combat this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process, enabling users to selectively disclose information and prevent linking of separate interactions without requiring changes to existing credential issuance systems.</h2>

    <h1>Kuo: AirPods Pro 3 Coming Soon, But Bigger Upgrade Arriving Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that the AirPods Pro 3 are expected to be released in the second half of 2025, possibly at the September iPhone 17 event. These new earbuds are anticipated to feature heart rate monitoring, a smaller charging case, improved sound quality, and enhanced active noise cancellation. Kuo also predicts a more significant hardware upgrade in 2026, potentially including infrared cameras for advanced spatial audio with Apple Vision Pro and in-air gesture control.</h2>
