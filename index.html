    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled with efficiently providing accurate answers to complex professional inquiries due to vast, multimodal product data and technical documentation. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system built on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% by better understanding multimodal content, utilizing an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning, offering a significant boost to customer service.</h2>
