    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and profiled. To counter this, Microsoft Research created Crescent, a cryptographic library that brings "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge SNARKs with a two-stage process to enable users to selectively share information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing linking identifiers, integrating without requiring updates to existing issuer systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple is appealing a court order that prevents it from collecting fees for external purchases linked within App Store apps, arguing it is an unconstitutional taking of its intellectual property and an overreach of judicial power. This order arose from the Epic Games lawsuit, where an initial injunction allowed external links, but Apple's subsequent 12-27% fees led the court to rule Apple was in "willful violation," resulting in the current no-fee, no-control mandate. Apple contends the new injunction improperly expanded the original order, violates its First Amendment rights, and is too broad for a single plaintiff, requesting it be vacated to potentially reimplement fees.</h2>
