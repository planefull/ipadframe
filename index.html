    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," a collaborative effort led by Microsoft, revealed a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, the team developed and implemented "patches" for these screening tools, significantly strengthening them against AI-generated threats. This project not only created a more AI-resilient biosecurity framework but also pioneered a new approach to managing sensitive scientific information, demonstrating a collaborative model for addressing dual-use technology risks across industry, government, and non-profit sectors.</h2>

    <h2>Apple is currently beta testing iOS 26.1, the first major update to iOS 26, which introduces various new features and interface changes without bringing the anticipated new Siri version. Key updates include a "slide to stop" option for alarms, custom workout creation in the Fitness app, new language support for Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation, and swipe gestures in Apple Music to change songs. Additionally, the update brings numerous interface tweaks like left-aligned text in Settings and Home Screen folders, visual enhancements to the Phone and Photos apps, and for iPadOS 26.1, the reintroduction of Slide Over multitasking.</h2>
