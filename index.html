    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical biosecurity vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to bypass existing DNA synthesis screening systems, a finding dubbed the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. In response, a cross-sector team developed and implemented more robust, AI-resilient screening solutions, effectively patching this vulnerability. This proactive cybersecurity-style approach, detailed in *Science*, strengthens global biosecurity against the potential misuse of dual-use AI technologies and establishes a model for responsible information sharing in emerging fields.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming iOS 26.4 is set to introduce a revamped Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, but some of the company's software engineers reportedly have "concerns" about its performance. This information comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who did not specify the nature of these shortcomings. Apple has five to six months before the expected March or April release of iOS 26.4 to address any issues, though previous delays suggest the launch could be further pushed back if problems persist.</h2>
