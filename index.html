    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance faces significant bottlenecks due to limitations in current copper and optical data links, which force compromises between power efficiency, reliability, and reach, leading to issues like ultra-dense, power-hungry GPU racks. Microsoft Research has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology that addresses this by adopting a "wide-and-slow" architecture using hundreds of parallel low-speed microLED channels. This breakthrough offers copper-like power efficiency and reliability over long distances (up to 50 meters), promising substantial energy savings, drastically reduced failure rates, and the potential to unlock new architectures for AI infrastructure, compute, and memory designs.</h2>
