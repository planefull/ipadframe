    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to provide accurate answers to complex customer inquiries due to thousands of product models and diverse, multimodal technical documentation. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by leveraging PIKE-RAG's ability to parse multimodal content, eliminate reliance on erroneous data sources, and perform dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex questions.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Fold to Feature Industry-First 24MP Under-Display Camera</h1>
    <h2>Apple's first foldable iPhone is rumored to feature an industry-first 24-megapixel under-screen camera built into its inner display, according to a JP Morgan forecast. This high-resolution camera represents a significant technological advancement over current Android under-display cameras, potentially offering clearer images despite display layers. However, to maintain a compact design, the device might lack features like LiDAR and optical image stabilization, with its launch date possibly ranging from next year to 2027.</h2>
