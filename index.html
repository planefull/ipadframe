    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," allowing hidden identifiers to connect separate online activities and build user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process to enable users to selectively disclose information and verify facts without revealing data that could link their distinct interactions, enhancing privacy without requiring issuing organizations to update their existing systems.</h2>
