    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast *Ideas* features the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design and its impact on biosecurity. Researchers demonstrated that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, in ways that bypassed existing biosecurity screening systems, identifying a critical "zero day" vulnerability. To address this, a cross-sector team developed and implemented "patches" for screening tools and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data sharing, setting a new precedent for managing information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>
