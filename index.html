    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research collaborated with Drexel University and the Broad Institute to explore how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. The study identified significant challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new findings and synthesizing vast scientific literature, aiming to increase diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for patients.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is accelerating development of its smart glasses, prioritizing them over the next Vision Pro, with a potential announcement in late 2026. These fashion-forward glasses will heavily rely on an advanced, AI-powered Siri for voice controls, enabling features like photo/video, audio, directions, and visual intelligence. The first-generation model will lack a display and require an iPhone for AI processing and full functionality, aiming to compete with Meta's smart glasses.</h2>
