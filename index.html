    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare genetic diseases efficiently due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, resulting in low diagnostic yields and lengthy reanalysis processes. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored designing a generative AI assistant to support these professionals. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis, and improving collaborative sensemaking, ultimately enhancing diagnosis rates and patient outcomes.</h2>
