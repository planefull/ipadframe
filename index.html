    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to complex technical inquiries due to the vast and multimodal nature of their product documentation. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling advanced multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities across various industries.</h2>
