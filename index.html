    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Ideas" podcast episode features the Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, which uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability in biosecurity. The project demonstrated that AI-powered protein design tools could be used to reformulate toxic proteins, such as ricin, in ways that bypassed existing DNA synthesis screening systems, highlighting the dual-use challenge of AI in biology. This led to a collaborative, cybersecurity-style response, resulting in a more robust protein screening system and a new "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data and software sharing to enhance global biosecurity.</h2>

    <h1>Samsung to Unveil Apple Vision Pro Competitor Tomorrow</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is set to unveil its long-awaited "Project Moohan" mixed reality headset tomorrow at a Galaxy Event, positioning it as an "AI-native" competitor to the Apple Vision Pro. Visually similar to the Vision Pro with a ski-goggle design and external battery, the headset will run on Android XR, an operating system co-developed with Google and Qualcomm. Project Moohan will feature extensive AI capabilities through Gemini for device controls and insights, alongside immersive Google app integrations for YouTube, Maps, Chrome, and 3D Google Photos.</h2>
