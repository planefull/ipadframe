    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to information overload and lengthy diagnostic processes. To address this, a collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline analysis by synthesizing critical gene and variant data and flagging cases for reanalysis, ultimately boosting diagnostic yield and reducing the time for patients to receive a diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Watch SE 3 Review: Premium Features Without the Premium Price</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly upgraded the Apple Watch SE 3 after a three-year wait, incorporating several premium features without increasing its $249 starting price. Key new additions include an Always-On display, a faster S10 chip enabling Double Tap and Wrist Flick gestures, 64GB storage, and advanced health functions like temperature sensing and Sleep Apnea detection. While it lacks some high-end features of the more expensive Series 11, the SE 3 offers a compelling and affordable upgrade with faster charging and 5G connectivity, making it ideal for those seeking advanced features at a lower cost.</h2>
