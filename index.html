    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>Agentic AI systems are leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate a vast "society of tools," expanding their capabilities through horizontal integration. However, this leads to "tool-space interference," where factors like excessive tool counts, long response lengths, complex parameter schemas, tool name collisions, and inadequate error handling reduce overall system effectiveness. To address these challenges, the article proposes evergreen recommendations for protocol developers (e.g., formal namespaces), server developers (e.g., transparent documentation), client developers (e.g., optimizations and collision resolution), and market developers (e.g., centralized optimizations).</h2>

    <h1>Here Are 5 Smaller iPhone Air Details You Might Have Missed, Including Only a Single Speaker</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone Air launches on Friday, featuring a single speaker (with the earpiece doubling) and a Dynamic Island positioned slightly lower than on Pro models. The device is limited to slower USB 2 data transfer speeds and takes longer to charge to 50% compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, also supporting lower MagSafe wireless charging. Furthermore, its A19 Pro chip has a 5-core GPU, resulting in a slight hit to graphics performance compared to the Pro models' 6-core GPU.</h2>
