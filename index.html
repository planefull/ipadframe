    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach allows agents to monitor conditions for hours or days without exhausting their context window, significantly improving task reliability and paving the way for more patient, proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>If You Thought Ads in Apple Maps Was Bad, Samsung is Putting Ads on $1,900+ Refrigerators</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is rolling out a software update to its "Family Hub" smart refrigerators, which retail for over $1,899, that will introduce advertisements on their integrated displays. Starting November 3, these ads will appear by default on the idle Cover screen, initially showcasing Samsung products, with plans to include third-party advertisers in the future. This decision has surprised many existing customers who purchased the appliances without anticipating ads, though users can opt out, albeit by disabling all other widget features.</h2>
