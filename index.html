    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected LED lighting, faced challenges providing accurate and efficient answers to complex technical queries due to vast, multimodal product data and limitations of traditional RAG systems. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia, integrating the specialized PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, establishing an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning, showcasing PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial scenarios.</h2>

    <h1>In-Depth iPhone Battery Experiment Pits Slow Charging Against Fast Charging</h1>
    <h2>HTX Studio conducted a six-month battery test using iPhone 12 models to compare the effects of fast versus slow charging and different charge ranges on battery life. The experiment revealed minimal additional battery drain from fast charging and only a marginal benefit from keeping an iPhone between 30 and 80 percent charge. Ultimately, HTX Studio concluded that users should charge their iPhones "however they like" without overthinking it, as the gain in battery life isn't worth the mental effort.</h2>
