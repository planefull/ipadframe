    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email or price drop, because they fail to intelligently manage *when* to check, leading to resource waste or premature termination. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods through dynamic polling adjustments and careful context management. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly boosts agent reliability for longer monitoring tasks, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Scores Legal Victory as Judge Decertifies 2011 App Store Antitrust Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple today secured a legal victory as a judge decertified a long-running antitrust class action lawsuit, originally filed in 2011, which accused the company of monopolizing the iPhone app ecosystem. The decertification occurred because the plaintiffs repeatedly failed to demonstrate classwide harm or reliably calculate damages, with their expert testimony and data deemed unreliable by the court. This decision means the case can no longer proceed on behalf of all iPhone users, instead requiring individual lawsuits for anyone wishing to sue Apple over the matter, though the plaintiffs plan to appeal.</h2>
