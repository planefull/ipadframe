    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast *Ideas* discusses the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI tools for protein design could be misused to create toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers, including Microsoft's Eric Horvitz and Bruce Wittmann, along with experts from IBBIS and Twist Bioscience, demonstrated this "zero day" vulnerability by generating AI-rewritten versions of toxic proteins that evaded detection. This led to a collaborative, cybersecurity-style response, resulting in more robust protein screening systems and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, setting a precedent for managing dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is expected to introduce a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, which will feature enhanced capabilities like on-screen awareness and personal context. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers have expressed "concerns" regarding the performance of this overhauled Siri. Apple has about five to six months before the anticipated March or April release to address these issues, especially given that the new Siri has already faced previous delays.</h2>
