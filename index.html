    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to efficiently manage checking intervals and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days through dynamic polling and careful context management within a workflow. Integrated into their open-source Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability for longer durations, fostering the development of proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>OpenAI Acquires Apple Shortcuts Creators to Bring Deep Mac Integration to ChatGPT</h1>
    <h2>OpenAI has acquired Software Applications Incorporated and its Mac-based natural language AI assistant, Sky. Sky was developed by former Apple employees Ari Weinstein and Conrad Kramer, known for creating the popular Workflow app which Apple later acquired and evolved into its Shortcuts feature. OpenAI plans to integrate Sky's deep macOS capabilities into ChatGPT, with the entire Sky team joining the company, aiming to enhance AI functionality across its offerings.</h2>
