    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track users across various credential uses, such as mobile driver's licenses and app logins. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing iOS 18.7 for iPhones as iOS 26 Release Date Nears</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7, expected in September, which will likely offer security fixes and be one of the final updates for older devices like the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. These older models will not be compatible with iOS 26, which supports iPhone 11 and newer. iOS 26 is also nearing its public release, anticipated around mid-September, after months of beta testing.</h2>
