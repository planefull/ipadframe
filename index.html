    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft Research, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, responded by developing and deploying "patches" – more robust AI-resilient screening solutions – to strengthen global biosecurity. This effort also pioneered a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive scientific data and methods, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing dual-use AI risks in biotechnology.</h2>
