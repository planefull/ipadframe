    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex, long-form visual data, lacking the ability for temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement over large datasets. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning over extensive video and image collections. This agent framework employs modality-specific tools and iterative self-evaluation to deliver accurate, explainable, and scalable multimodal question-answering, significantly outperforming base models on various benchmarks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</h1>
    <h2>A Texas District Judge has ruled that Apple and OpenAI must face a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI startup, denying their bid for dismissal. xAI claims Apple and OpenAI are conspiring to dominate the AI market by exclusively integrating ChatGPT into Siri, thereby disadvantaging competing AI chatbots like Grok. The lawsuit alleges this arrangement harms competition, limits user choice, and seeks to halt their "anticompetitive scheme" while recovering billions in damages.</h2>
