    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and lengthy waits for patients. To address this, Microsoft Research collaborated with Drexel University and the Broad Institute to design a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals' sensemaking tasks. This AI aims to streamline analysis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific evidence and synthesizing gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Watch's High Blood Pressure Notifications Approved in Canada</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Watch's Hypertension Notifications feature, designed to detect signs of chronic high blood pressure, has received licensing from Health Canada and is expected to launch in the country soon. Already available in over 150 regions, this feature passively analyzes optical heart sensor data over 30-day intervals to alert users if consistent signs of hypertension are detected. Compatible with Apple Watch Series 9/Ultra 2 and later running watchOS 26, it serves as a notification system rather than a direct blood pressure measurement, and is not for individuals under 22, those previously diagnosed with hypertension, or during pregnancy.</h2>
