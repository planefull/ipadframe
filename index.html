    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where separate uses of electronic credentials can be tracked to create user profiles. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information without revealing identifiers that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Refurbished Apple Pencil Pro Now Available in U.S. at a Discount</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Pencil Pro is now available in Apple's online refurbished store in the U.S. and Canada for the first time since its May 2024 launch. In the U.S., it's priced at $109, offering a 15% discount from the brand new $129 price. However, this refurbished option currently provides minimal savings as Amazon sells a new Apple Pencil Pro for only $1.87 more, though Apple guarantees its refurbished products are like-new after extensive testing and cleaning.</h2>
