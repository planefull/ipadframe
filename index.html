    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling a thriving "society of tools" for agentic AI systems, allowing for horizontal integration and greatly expanding agent capabilities. However, this growing ecosystem faces "tool-space interference" challenges, such as excessive tool counts, overly long responses, complex parameter schemas, and naming collisions, which can significantly reduce end-to-end effectiveness and lead to task failures. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, enhancing protocol support for client-provided resources, encouraging transparent server documentation, and optimizing client-side integrations to foster a more reliable and scalable AI agent infrastructure.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Includes Adaptive Temperature Option for Automatic Thermostat Adjustment</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 introduces a new Home app feature called Adaptive Temperature, designed to automatically adjust your thermostat based on whether anyone is home. This feature uses Activity History to detect "home," "away," and "extended away" states, predicting user arrival and adjusting temperatures accordingly, and can also switch temperature modes or use occupancy sensors. While found within thermostat settings, it's currently unclear if the feature is fully functional or requires updates from thermostat manufacturers, as some users report difficulty finding it.</h2>
