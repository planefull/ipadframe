    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project investigated the "dual-use" nature of AI in biology, specifically how AI-powered protein design tools could be misused to create toxic proteins capable of evading existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers discovered that open-source AI could "paraphrase" dangerous protein sequences, prompting a cross-sector team to develop and implement cybersecurity-style "patches" to strengthen global biosecurity screening. This effort highlighted the critical need for continuous vigilance, proactive defense mechanisms, and a novel approach to responsible information sharing to manage the evolving risks of AI in synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing iOS 26.0.2 Update for iPhones</h1>
    <h2>Apple is internally testing iOS 26.0.2, which MacRumors logs suggest will be a minor update focused on bug fixes and security vulnerabilities. This update is expected to be released within the next few weeks, following the recent iOS 26.0.1 release that addressed various issues, including Wi-Fi, cellular, camera problems, and a security vulnerability. Additionally, macOS 26.0.2 is also being tested and could launch alongside the iOS update, potentially on a new MacBook Pro model featuring an M5 chip.</h2>
