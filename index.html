    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, faced challenges in efficiently providing accurate technical answers to professional users due to its vast and complex product documentation. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate their PIKE-RAG technology into its knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, ensuring reliable data sources, and facilitating dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries.</h2>
