    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email response or price drop, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days through dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for extended durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive, efficient, and user-aligned AI assistants capable of handling real-world monitoring needs.</h2>
