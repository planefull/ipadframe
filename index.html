    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, due to limitations in temporal understanding and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This system uses modality-specific agents and iterative feedback loops to analyze extensive visual data, significantly improving accuracy and enabling explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal question-answering.</h2>

    <h1>New HomePod Mini, Apple TV, and AirTag Were Expected This Year — Where Are They?</h1>
    <h2>Earlier rumors indicated Apple planned to release updated HomePod mini, Apple TV, and AirTag models in 2025, but it is now late in the year with no official announcements. Despite some signs like low HomePod mini inventory suggesting an imminent refresh, other factors such as Apple's holiday product messaging and typical release schedules point to potential delays. It's increasingly speculated that the HomePod mini and Apple TV updates might be postponed until 2026 to coincide with a revamped Siri, while the reason for the AirTag's hold-up remains less clear.</h2>
