    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex, long-form visual data, needing advanced reasoning beyond short-clip analysis and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on an AutoGen Planner–Critic architecture. This system uses specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent tools for iterative, structured reasoning, significantly improving performance on large video and image collections by integrating perception, deliberation, and self-evaluation.</h2>

    <h1>Top Stories: Tim Cook's 2026 Exit?, Mac Pro on Hold, and More</h1>
    <h2>This week's Apple news was dominated by a report suggesting Tim Cook might step down as CEO as early as next year, with the Mac Pro also reportedly "on the back burner" and "largely written off." Apple continues to develop iOS 26.2, which introduces new AirDrop functionality and other improvements, while also releasing a limited-edition iPhone Pocket accessory that quickly sold out. Additionally, a new study revealed significantly faster Wi-Fi speeds for the iPhone 17 series, and early Black Friday deals are now widely available.</h2>
