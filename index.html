    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs and preprocessing to enable users to selectively disclose information and prevent tracking without requiring issuing organizations to update their systems.</h2>
