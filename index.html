    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore how generative AI could enhance the "sensemaking" tasks involved in this process. The research proposes an AI assistant designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesize gene and variant information from scientific literature, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 16 Pro Max 80% Charge Limit: One Year Later, Was It Worth It?</h1>
    <h2>The author conducted a year-long experiment on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, consistently limiting its charge to 80% to assess its impact on battery longevity. After 12 months, the phone's battery capacity was 94% with 299 charge cycles, a result similar to the author's previous iPhone 15 Pro Max test and a coworker's phone without the limit. Ultimately, the author concluded that the 80% charge limit was inconvenient and did not provide significant battery health benefits over a one-year period, deeming it not worth the effort.</h2>
