    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers in credentials can be used to track and profile user behavior across different applications. To counter this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, functioning efficiently on mobile devices and without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Refurbished Apple Pencil Pro Now Available in U.S. at a Discount</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Pencil Pro is now available in Apple's online refurbished stores in the U.S. and Canada for $109, marking its first appearance since its May 2024 launch and offering a roughly 15% discount. However, this refurbished price provides minimal savings, as a new Apple Pencil Pro can currently be purchased for only $1.87 more on Amazon. Despite the small discount, Apple's refurbished products undergo rigorous testing, cleaning, and replacement of defective parts, ensuring they are in like-new condition and retain all key features like squeeze gestures and haptic feedback.</h2>
