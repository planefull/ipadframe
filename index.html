    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected lighting, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to complex technical questions due to vast product data and diverse documentation formats. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This advanced RAG solution excels at parsing multimodal content like charts and tables, creating end-to-end knowledge loops, and performing multi-hop reasoning for intricate queries. As a result, Signify achieved a significant 12% improvement in answer accuracy, validating PIKE-RAG's strong performance and potential for generalization across various industrial applications.</h2>
