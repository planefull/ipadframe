    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in accurately interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnosis rates and lengthy reanalysis processes for rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to enhance "sensemaking" during analysis. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing complex biomedical information, flagging cases for reanalysis, and improving collaborative efforts, ultimately boosting diagnoses and improving patient quality of life.</h2>
