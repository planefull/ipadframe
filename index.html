    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to resource waste or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Giving Vision Pro Another Chance</h1>
    <h2>The latest episode of The MacRumors Show dives into Apple's new Vision Pro headset, featuring an M5 chip. This updated model offers enhanced performance, 10% more rendered pixels, a 120Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, and an improved counterweighted headband for comfort. The hosts discuss how much better the new Vision Pro truly is, running visionOS 26 with features like widgets and enhanced Personas, and if it's finally time to reconsider Apple's spatial computing device.</h2>
