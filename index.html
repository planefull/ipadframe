    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they cannot effectively "wait" without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and validated through a synthetic testing suite called SentinelBench, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended tasks, laying the groundwork for more practical and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
