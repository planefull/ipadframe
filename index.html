    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the immense data from whole genome sequencing, leading to information overload and difficulties in case reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to support genetic professionals in complex sensemaking tasks. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>FCC Leaks Upcoming MacBook Pro and More</h1>
    <h2>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has inadvertently confirmed Apple's development of new devices by publishing documents that reference unreleased model numbers. These leaks include details on a new MacBook Pro (A3434) and several M5 iPad Pro models (A3357-A3362), with the new iPad Pros appearing to support Wi-Fi 7. While specific details are scarce, the filings confirm Apple's work and suggest a potential launch timeline, with iPad Pros expected by late 2025 and MacBook Pros in late 2025 to early 2026.</h2>
