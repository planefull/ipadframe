    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning tasks involving long-form video and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This system employs specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent tools, allowing for deliberate, iterative analysis and refinement of answers, significantly enhancing accuracy and scalability in handling extensive visual data.</h2>
