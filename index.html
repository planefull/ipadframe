    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes because they lack the ability to know *when* to check and manage context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions patiently for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents for longer tasks, paving the way for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>M4 vs. M5 iPad Pro Buyer's Guide: 20 Differences Compared</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new M5 iPad Pro, arriving just 18 months after the M4 model, offers iterative updates focused on chip performance and connectivity rather than a major redesign. Key upgrades include a faster M5 chip (up to 15% faster CPU, 30% faster graphics), enhanced AI capabilities, increased baseline memory, double SSD speeds, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and 120Hz external display support. However, these gains are primarily beneficial for users upgrading from older iPads or those with extremely demanding AI-driven workflows and professional external monitor needs, as most M4 users will not see significant practical differences.</h2>
