    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for updates without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a new mechanism that enables agents to patiently complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management within their Magentic-UI system. Initial evaluations show SentinelStep significantly boosts reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more proactive, efficient, and always-on AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>If You Thought Ads in Apple Maps Was Bad, Samsung is Putting Ads on $1,900+ Refrigerators</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is rolling out a software update to its "Family Hub" smart refrigerators, which can cost up to $3,499, to display advertisements on their integrated screens starting in November. These ads, initially for Samsung products but with plans for third-party advertisers, will appear on the Cover screen when the fridge is idle, surprising many existing customers who purchased the appliances without this expectation. While users can opt out of the ads through the settings, doing so currently disables all other widget functionalities on the appliance's display.</h2>
