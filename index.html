    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, revealing that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences in ways that bypass current biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. This discovery, deemed the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity, prompted a cross-sector team to develop a cybersecurity-style response, including "red-teaming" approaches to probe vulnerabilities and implement practical fixes. The project culminated in a more robust protein screening system and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing sensitive research data, aiming to strengthen biosecurity while responsibly advancing science.</h2>

    <h1>Select GM Vehicles May Soon Offer iPhone Car Key Support</h1>
    <h2>Code discovered by *MacRumors* suggests that select General Motors vehicles, including Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac models, will soon integrate with Apple Wallet for digital car key support. This feature enables users to lock, unlock, and start their cars using the NFC capabilities of their iPhone or Apple Watch. While specific models beyond the 2026 Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV are not yet confirmed, this expands Apple's digital key ecosystem to more major automotive brands.</h2>
