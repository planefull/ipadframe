    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a significant biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, like ricin, allowing them to evade existing screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style defense, creating a more robust protein screening system and sharing these "patches" globally through organizations like the International Gene Synthesis Consortium. This project also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data sharing, establishing a model for proactively addressing the dual-use dilemmas and information hazards posed by rapidly advancing AI and synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Air to Launch in China This Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the iPhone Air will be available for pre-order in China this Friday, October 17, with a launch set for October 22. Its release was initially postponed due to regulatory issues surrounding its eSIM-only design, a feature not traditionally supported by Chinese carriers for iPhones. However, all three state-owned telecommunications operators will now provide eSIM support, clearing the way for the 5.6mm thick device, which starts from 7,999 yuan.</h2>
