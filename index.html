    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and prioritizing case reanalysis, resulting in prolonged diagnostic journeys. To address this, a collaborative study developed a generative AI assistant prototype designed to support these professionals by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data. This AI-enhanced system aims to streamline complex sensemaking tasks, ultimately improving diagnostic yield, reducing diagnosis time, and enhancing patient outcomes for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
