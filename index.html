    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse documentation formats. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system, leveraging its ability to parse multimodal documents, establish end-to-end knowledge loops, and perform multi-hop reasoning. This implementation led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy and showcased PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial knowledge scenarios.</h2>

    <h1>B&H Lists HomePod Mini as Discontinued Amid Refresh Rumors</h1>
    <h2>Apple product retailer B&H has listed all HomePod mini models as discontinued, with many other third-party retailers also reporting low stock or backorders. This scarcity at various vendors, despite Apple still selling them directly, suggests that an updated HomePod mini model is not far off. The rumored refresh is expected to include upgraded internal chips and potentially new color options, with a possible release before the end of 2025.</h2>
