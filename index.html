    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring activities due to their inability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling adjustments and careful context management. This enables agents to reliably perform long-running monitoring tasks—like watching for price drops or email responses—for hours or days, significantly improving success rates and laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>A20 and A20 Pro Chips (2nm) Expected to Debut in These iPhone Models</h1>
    <h2>A new rumor indicates Apple is developing two versions of its A20 chip, the A20 and A20 Pro, for the upcoming iPhone 18 series. These chips are expected to be manufactured using TSMC's advanced 2nm process, promising significant year-over-year performance and power efficiency improvements, with some A20 chips potentially integrating RAM directly onto the wafer. The standard iPhone 18 will feature the A20 chip, while the iPhone 18 Pro models and a rumored foldable iPhone will utilize the A20 Pro, with releases potentially staggered across 2026 and 2027.</h2>
