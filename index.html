    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and connect users' separate digital activities to create detailed profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or identifiers that could link their separate interactions, and it does so without requiring changes to existing issuer systems.</h2>
