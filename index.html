    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers from its vast and complex product documentation to professional users. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system, hosted on Microsoft Azure. This collaboration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling the system to better parse multimodal documents, establish end-to-end knowledge loops, and perform dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries.</h2>
