    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow tracking and profiling of user activities across different applications and credentials. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to present specific credential information without revealing data that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring existing issuing organizations to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple is appealing a court order that requires it to allow developers to link to external purchases with no fees or design restrictions, arguing the mandate is unconstitutional and strips them of compensation for their intellectual property. The company claims the updated injunction improperly expanded the original order and forces them to convey messages they disagree with. Furthermore, Apple contends the injunction is too broad, applying universally when it should be tailored only to the plaintiff, Epic Games.</h2>
