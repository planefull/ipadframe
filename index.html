    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with long-form video and large image collections, lacking the temporal reasoning and iterative refinement needed for complex real-world analysis. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which uses a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This framework employs modality-specific agents and tool-based reasoning for both images and videos, enabling iterative self-evaluation and significantly improving performance on complex visual understanding tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Another Designer Leaves Apple</h1>
    <h2>Abidur Chowdhury, a rising star designer who introduced the iPhone Air, has departed Apple to join an AI startup, marking a significant internal event. His departure continues a trend of several high-profile designers leaving Apple since Jony Ive's exit in 2019, leaving few remaining from that era. This shift comes as the design team's former oversight, Jeff Williams, also retired, leading to the team now reporting directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</h2>
