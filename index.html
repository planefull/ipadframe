    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as monitoring email or price drops, because they lack the ability to "wait" efficiently, leading to either excessive checking or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of long-duration tasks, paving the way for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 11-Inch M5 iPad Pro Hits New Low Price of $949 on Amazon</h1>
    <h2>Amazon has introduced a new all-time low price for the entry-level 11-inch M5 iPad Pro, now available for $949, a $50 discount. This new deal expands on previous discounts, which largely focused on the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro, still available with savings of $50 to $100 depending on the model. These represent some of the first significant price reductions on Apple's recently launched M5 iPad Pro lineup.</h2>
