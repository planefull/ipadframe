    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is complex due to the overwhelming volume of whole genome sequencing data, information overload for genetic professionals, and challenges in reanalyzing unsolved cases. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored designing a generative AI assistant to support genetic professionals in these sensemaking tasks. This AI assistant would streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to increase diagnostic yield and improve patient outcomes.</h2>
