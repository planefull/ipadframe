    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the significant challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. They co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline the complex, data-intensive process of analyzing genetic information. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by synthesizing vast biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating crucial gene and variant information from literature.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is withdrawing most of its claims against Apple concerning a 2021 email sent by CEO Tim Cook to employees. Cook's email warned against leaking confidential information and stated that leakers do not belong at Apple, following a leak about an internal meeting on topics like pay equity. The NLRB had previously alleged that Apple's anti-leak rules and the email violated U.S. labor law by potentially interfering with employees' rights.</h2>
