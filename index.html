    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks like "linkability," where separate uses of digital credentials can be tracked to build extensive user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this using efficient zero-knowledge proofs optimized for mobile devices through preprocessing, allowing users to selectively disclose information while preventing their various digital interactions from being linked without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>
