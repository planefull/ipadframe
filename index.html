    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently complete these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow over extended periods. Implemented in Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly boosts task reliability for durations lasting hours, laying the groundwork for more efficient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Announces Three App Store Updates for Developers</h1>
    <h2>Apple has updated its App Store review process, offering developers greater flexibility to submit items like bug fixes or in-app events even when other app versions are already under review. Developers can now also create up to 70 custom product pages with keyword support to better highlight app features and content. Furthermore, Apple expanded offer codes to all In-App Purchase types, including a new option for non-renewing promotional periods, replacing promo codes for IAPs.</h2>
