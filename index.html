    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more proactive, efficient, and long-running AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>Sam Sung, an Apple retail employee, went viral in 2012 due to his name being identical to Apple's competitor, Samsung, causing him significant stress and paranoia about his job. Apple responded by pulling him from the store floor and removing his business cards as media attention grew. After leaving Apple, Sung eventually changed his last name to Struan to escape being an "internet joke," though he now wishes he had seen the situation as more amusing.</h2>
