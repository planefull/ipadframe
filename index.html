    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, prompting concerns about dual-use technology risks. To address this, a collaborative team developed an AI red-teaming pipeline to generate these AI-rewritten proteins, subsequently designing and implementing "patches" to create more robust screening tools. This effort significantly strengthened global biosecurity measures, was published in *Science*, and established a new framework for the responsible disclosure and sharing of sensitive dual-use research data.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Foldable iPhone Rumored to Use Titanium and Aluminum Frame</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone, expected to launch in 2026 as part of the iPhone 18 lineup, is rumored to feature a frame made from a mix of titanium and aluminum. This choice of materials is crucial for ensuring the device's durability and preventing bending, especially for its anticipated ultra-thin design. While analyst Jeff Pu points to titanium and aluminum, Ming-Chi Kuo previously suggested titanium and stainless steel for the chassis and hinge components, potentially including Liquidmetal.</h2>
