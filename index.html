    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, failing to know *when* to check for updates, which leads to giving up or wasting resources. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by employing dynamic polling and careful context management within a workflow. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Scores Legal Victory as Judge Decertifies 2011 App Store Antitrust Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple scored a significant legal victory as a judge decertified a long-running antitrust class action lawsuit, originally filed in 2011, which accused the company of monopolizing the iPhone app ecosystem. The lawsuit was decertified because the plaintiffs failed to provide reliable methods to prove classwide harm and calculate damages, with their expert's testimony deemed unqualified and unreliable. This means the case can no longer proceed as a class action, requiring individual lawsuits for any future claims, although the plaintiffs plan to appeal.</h2>
