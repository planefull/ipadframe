    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, failing because they lack the ability to know *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task abandonment. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management to prevent context overflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants capable of monitoring conditions and acting only when necessary.</h2>

    <h1>New Version of Siri to 'Lean' on Google Gemini</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, set for around March 2026, which will be accompanied by new smart home products like a display, Apple TV, and HomePod mini. This revamped Siri will reportedly utilize a custom Google Gemini-based model running on Apple's private cloud infrastructure, ensuring an Apple user experience without directly integrating Google services. While Apple intends to showcase Apple Intelligence prominently in its 2026 operating system updates, it faces ongoing regulatory challenges for the feature's launch in China, and Mark Gurman cautions about potential user adoption issues.</h2>
