    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle with diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI assistant designed to streamline the process. This AI tool aims to flag unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific discoveries and efficiently synthesize vast amounts of genetic literature, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and shortening the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store Moving Soon at University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Store at University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas, is moving to a new, larger location within the same shopping center. The new store, which will feature an updated design, is set to open on Saturday, October 11, at 10 a.m. local time, taking over a space previously occupied by Jos. A. Bank and The Impeccable Pig. The original Apple store, which opened in 2008, remains operational until the new site on the north side of the village opens.</h2>
