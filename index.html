    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed Magentic Marketplace, an open-source simulation environment to study the complex dynamics and societal implications of autonomous AI agents interacting within digital markets. Experiments using this platform revealed that while agents can improve consumer welfare with effective discovery mechanisms, they also suffer from a "Paradox of Choice" (more options reduce welfare), are highly vulnerable to manipulation tactics, and exhibit systemic biases like preferring the first offer. These findings underscore significant vulnerabilities in even state-of-the-art AI models, emphasizing the critical need for careful marketplace design, human oversight, and continued simulation research to ensure fair and beneficial outcomes as agentic economies emerge.</h2>

    <h1>Apple to Remove iPhone-Apple Watch Wi-Fi Sync in EU With iOS 26.2</h1>
    <h2>Apple will disable automatic Wi-Fi network syncing between iPhones and Apple Watches in the European Union with iOS 26.2. This change is a response to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements, which Apple has criticized, arguing it could compromise user security and privacy. Consequently, EU users may need to manually enter Wi-Fi passwords on their Apple Watch when their paired iPhone is out of range, though the watch will still connect automatically when the iPhone is nearby.</h2>
