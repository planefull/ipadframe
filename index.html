    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with long-form video and large image collections, lacking temporal reasoning and iterative refinement for complex real-world tasks. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system uses modality-specific agents and iterative reasoning with tools to analyze complex queries across extensive visual data, significantly enhancing base model performance and providing explainable, scalable insights.</h2>

    <h2>Apple Wallet now allows residents in select U.S. states to add their driver's license or state ID to their iPhone and Apple Watch, offering a convenient and contactless method for displaying proof of identity or age. This feature recently launched in Illinois, expanding its availability to 14 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, with more states anticipated to join. Digital IDs in Apple Wallet are accepted at TSA checkpoints in over 250 airports and can also be used for age or identity verification at select businesses and within certain apps.</h2>
