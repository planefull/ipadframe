    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, discovering that AI tools could generate toxic protein sequences capable of bypassing existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team then developed a "red-teaming" pipeline to expose these vulnerabilities and create "patches," significantly strengthening the industry's screening capabilities against AI-designed threats. This initiative not only enhanced biosecurity but also established a novel framework for responsible disclosure and perpetual access control for sensitive research, setting a precedent for managing information hazards in other dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple's website indicates that an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro will be available to order again on Wednesday, October 22, the same day the Vision Pro with the M5 chip launches. This suggests Apple plans to release an upgraded version of the accessory, as the current model is limited to USB 2.0 speeds despite its potential for Thunderbolt. While the strap provides a crucial USB-C connection for app development and diagnostics, details regarding its new features, pricing, or compatibility with the original Vision Pro are currently unknown.</h2>
