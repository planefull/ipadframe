    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the significant challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. They designed a generative AI assistant prototype to help manage information overload, facilitate collaborative sharing, and prioritize cases for reanalysis. This AI-enhanced approach aims to streamline the complex sensemaking process, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time it takes to diagnose rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has withdrawn most claims against Apple regarding a 2021 email sent by CEO Tim Cook. The email warned employees about leaking confidential information and stated that those who leak "do not belong at Apple." The NLRB had previously accused Cook of violating U.S. labor law by potentially interfering with employees' rights, particularly after the email followed a leaked internal meeting.</h2>
