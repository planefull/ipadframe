    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and check for specific conditions without excessive polling or context overflow. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context effectively. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h2>Apple's new iPhone Air is reportedly experiencing very low demand, leading to significant production cuts of up to 80% by its supply chain. This week also brought the fourth beta of iOS 26.1, which introduces a new toggle allowing users to control the transparency of the Liquid Glass design. Additionally, new rumors outlined Apple's alleged plans for three future iPhone designs, including foldable models and a "zero" bezel device.</h2>
