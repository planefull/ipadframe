    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner-Critic architecture. This system leverages modality-specific agents and tool-based iterative reasoning, significantly enhancing performance, explainability, and scalability for analyzing complex queries across diverse visual data.</h2>

    <h2>Apple is expected to launch the 12th-generation iPad in spring 2026, bringing internal upgrades rather than a significant design overhaul. This new budget tablet will feature the A18 chip, enabling Apple Intelligence support and enhanced performance, along with the N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 connectivity. Maintaining its current design and similar pricing, the updated model will offer notable advancements making it worth the wait for prospective buyers.</h2>
