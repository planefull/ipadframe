    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they don't know *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or early failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, fostering the development of more patient, efficient, and proactive AI assistants.</h2>
