    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading lighting company, faced challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex, multimodal product documentation. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology within their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, proving its effectiveness beyond the lighting industry.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods 4 Drop to $89 Record Low Price on Amazon</h1>
    <h2>Apple's AirPods 4 (base model without Active Noise Cancellation) are currently on sale for $89.00 on Amazon, a significant drop from their original $129.00 price. This deal matches the lowest price ever tracked for this specific model, making it a notable discount. While the AirPods 4 with ANC are also reduced to $149.99, the article suggests holding out for a steeper discount on that version, and directs readers to other ongoing Apple Black Friday deals.</h2>
