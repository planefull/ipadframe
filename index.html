    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to help genetic professionals diagnose rare diseases more efficiently. They identified key challenges like information overload, collaborative sharing issues, and prioritizing case reanalysis in whole genome sequencing. The researchers co-designed an AI assistant prototype to address these by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing complex gene and variant data, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2, and tvOS 18.6. This means users who have updated their devices to the recently released iOS 26 can no longer downgrade to iOS 18. The company takes this measure to prevent the installation of older, less secure software, though initial upgrades to iOS 26 remain optional.</h2>
