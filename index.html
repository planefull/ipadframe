    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The rapid advancement of agentic AI, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for horizontal integration of diverse tools, is creating a "society of agents" and "tools." However, this leads to "tool-space interference," where tools and agents from different providers hinder each other's effectiveness due to issues like excessive tool counts, overly long responses, complex parameter schemas, and name collisions. To mitigate these challenges, the article recommends formal namespaces and client-provided resource specifications for the protocol, transparent server documentation, client-side optimizations like response summarization, and marketplace support for model-specific tool schemas.</h2>

    <h1>'A New Story': Apple Store in Tokyo Returning to Original 2003 Location</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Ginza store is set to return to its original location in Tokyo, after operating from a temporary spot for over three years while its former building was demolished and rebuilt. The temporary store will permanently close on Monday, September 22, with the new store at the original Ginza 3-ch≈çme address expected to open "soon," likely in the second half of 2025. To mark this occasion, which signifies the return of Apple's first retail store outside the U.S., a special commemorative wallpaper has been released.</h2>
