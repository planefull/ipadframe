    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and carefully managing context to prevent overflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability over extended durations and is open-sourced to advance the development of proactive, efficient, and user-aligned agent systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Scores Legal Victory as Judge Decertifies 2011 App Store Antitrust Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple has scored a major legal victory as a judge decertified a long-running antitrust class-action lawsuit filed in 2011, which accused the company of monopolizing the iPhone app ecosystem. The decertification occurred because the plaintiffs failed to provide reliable methods to prove classwide harm and calculate damages, with their expert's testimony deemed unqualified and unreliable. This means the case can no longer proceed as a class action representing all iPhone users, requiring individual lawsuits instead, although the plaintiffs plan to appeal the decision.</h2>
