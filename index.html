    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data interpretation, when diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI assistant prototype designed to synthesize vast amounts of biomedical data and enhance collaborative sensemaking. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic efficiency by flagging cases for reanalysis and aggregating crucial gene/variant information, ultimately shortening diagnosis times and improving patient quality of life.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2025 Product Roadmap: What's Still Coming</h1>
    <h2>Apple has several product refreshes anticipated before the end of 2025 or early 2026, following its major yearly events. Expected updates include an Apple TV with a faster A17 Pro chip, an iPad Pro and Vision Pro utilizing the new M5 chip, and internally improved HomePod mini and AirTag 2 models. While a MacBook Pro with an M5 chip is also rumored, its release timeline is less certain, and these new devices may be announced through press releases rather than a dedicated event.</h2>
