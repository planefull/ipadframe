    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast, complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to many unsolved cases and lengthy reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to support these professionals in complex data "sensemaking" tasks. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating relevant literature, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Teardown Reveals Apple's New Approach to Thermal Management and Repairs</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the iPhone 17 Pro reveals a new vapor chamber cooling system that effectively manages heat from the A19 Pro chip, preventing thermal throttling unlike previous models. While the battery is easier to replace thanks to a screw-secured tray, the device is less repairable overall due to Apple doing away with the dual-entry design, making many common repairs require display removal. Despite these challenges and a scratch-prone camera plateau, the iPhone 17 Pro earned a 7/10 repairability score, partly due to Apple providing day-one repair manuals.</h2>
