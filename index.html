    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research *Ideas* podcast episode discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design and its implications for biosecurity. Researchers discovered that AI could reformulate toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, leading to a "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team then developed and implemented more robust protein screening solutions and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible disclosure of sensitive scientific information, aiming to proactively strengthen defenses against AI-enabled biological threats.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV's 'Vibrant' Rebranding Starts to Appear in Latest iOS 26.1 Beta</h1>
    <h2>Apple TV+ is being rebranded as "Apple TV," introducing a new "vibrant identity." This updated look, featuring glass-like multicolor app icons and visuals, has begun to appear in the latest iOS 26.1 and tvOS 26.1 betas. While the rebrand is visible on press pages, it has not yet reached consumer-focused sites, and it remains to be seen if additional changes beyond the name and logo are planned.</h2>
