    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the emergence of a "society of agents" facilitated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), where diverse AI agents and tools from different developers must cooperate. However, this horizontal integration introduces "tool-space interference," leading to reduced effectiveness due to challenges such as excessive tool counts, overly long responses, complex parameter schemas, naming conflicts, and inadequate error messages. To mitigate these issues, the authors recommend implementing formal namespaces and client-provided resource specifications for MCP, alongside better documentation from server developers, client-side optimizations, and marketplace solutions for improved compatibility and tailored tool schemas.</h2>

    <h1>Here Are 5 Smaller iPhone Air Details You Might Have Missed, Including Only a Single Speaker</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone Air, launching Friday, includes several key differences compared to its Pro models that users might miss. It features only a single speaker, slower USB 2 data transfer speeds, and takes longer to charge while also offering reduced MagSafe wireless charging wattage. Additionally, the iPhone Air's A19 Pro chip has a 5-core GPU, leading to slightly lower graphics performance, and its Dynamic Island is positioned lower on the screen.</h2>
