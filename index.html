    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, primarily due to context limits and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen's Planner–Critic architecture. This agentic framework utilizes modality-specific tools and an iterative reasoning loop with self-evaluation, significantly enhancing performance for complex visual question-answering by integrating planning, reflection, and tool-based analysis over extensive multimodal data.</h2>

    <h1>When to Expect the iPhone Air 2 and 20th Anniversary iPhone With Camera Under Screen</h1>
    <h2>According to Mark Gurman, Apple intends to release a second-generation iPhone Air and a special 20th-anniversary iPhone at separate times in 2027. The iPhone Air 2 is anticipated around March 2027, potentially featuring a 2nm chip for improved performance and battery life, and might include a second rear camera. Following in September 2027, the anniversary iPhone is expected to showcase a curved glass screen with its front camera hidden underneath.</h2>
