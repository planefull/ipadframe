    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," which aimed to identify occupations where generative AI could be a useful tool for tasks like writing and information gathering in knowledge-based roles. The article stresses that the research *does not* conclude that AI will eliminate jobs and explicitly cautioned against this common misinterpretation. Instead, it highlights AI's potential to assist with subtasks, while acknowledging methodological limitations and the complex nature of human jobs beyond isolated tasks.</h2>
