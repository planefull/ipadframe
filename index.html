    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, including information overload and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI-based assistant to address these issues. This AI assistant is intended to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic rates and reduce the time to diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has withdrawn most of its claims against Apple regarding a 2021 email from CEO Tim Cook concerning information leaks. Cook's email, sent after internal meetings were leaked, warned employees about identifying and dealing with leakers, which the NLRB had initially accused of violating U.S. labor law by interfering with employees' rights. Consequently, the NLRB is no longer pursuing accusations that Apple broke the law through confidentiality rules or worker surveillance related to the email.</h2>
