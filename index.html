    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Traditional multimodal AI models struggle with complex tasks involving long-form video and large image datasets, as they lack temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This system employs modality-specific agents and iterative reasoning to select tools, evaluate results, and refine conclusions, significantly improving performance and explainability for complex queries across vast visual content.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</h1>
    <h2>A Texas District Judge has denied Apple and OpenAI's bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI startup, meaning the case will proceed. xAI accuses Apple and OpenAI of conspiring to dominate the AI market, specifically by integrating ChatGPT exclusively into Siri and neglecting competing AI products like Grok. The lawsuit claims this anti-competitive scheme unfairly limits user choice and deprives xAI of critical data and market access.</h2>
