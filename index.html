    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore how a generative AI assistant could support genetic professionals in these sensemaking tasks. This AI-enhanced tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnosis rates and patient quality of life.</h2>
