    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in contextual understanding and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. This framework utilizes modality-specific agents and specialized tools for tasks like video ingestion and image analysis, significantly enhancing accuracy, explainability, and extensibility for complex visual queries.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</h1>
    <h2>A Texas judge denied Apple and OpenAI's request to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI, which accuses the companies of conspiring to dominate the AI market. xAI claims Apple's exclusive integration of ChatGPT into Siri unfairly disadvantages competing generative AI chatbots like Grok, limiting user choice and depriving them of crucial data. The lawsuit seeks to halt this alleged anti-competitive scheme and recover billions in damages from Apple and OpenAI.</h2>
