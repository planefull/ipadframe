    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is increasingly constrained by a "networking wall" caused by the fundamental trade-off between power, reliability, and reach in current narrow-and-fast copper and optical communication links. Microsoft Research has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology designed to overcome this by using a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed channels leveraging microLEDs. This innovation provides low power consumption, high reliability, and long reach (up to 50 meters) simultaneously, promising significant power savings, reduced failure rates, and the enablement of new, more scalable AI infrastructure designs.</h2>
