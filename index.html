    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," a collaborative effort led by Microsoft Research, exposed a critical vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. This discovery, dubbed a "zero day" in AI biosecurity, prompted a cybersecurity-style response, leading to the development and global dissemination of more robust screening patches capable of detecting these AI-generated variants across a wider range of hazardous proteins. Beyond technical fixes, the project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing information hazards, promoting responsible data and software sharing to balance open science with mitigating the catastrophic risks associated with dual-use AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>When Will Apple's Macs Get M5 Chips? 2025-2026 Launch Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next-generation M5 silicon chip is expected to debut in some new products by the end of 2025, though the majority of Mac refreshes are slated for 2026. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a prime candidate for an early M5 update, possibly this year, while the iMac and Mac mini could also see refreshes in the late 2025 to early 2026 timeframe. MacBook Air models are set for early 2026, and higher-end machines like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, requiring M5 Max or Ultra chips, are not expected until mid-to-late 2026.</h2>
