    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnosis rates and long waiting periods. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively studied and designed a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool is intended to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific discoveries and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models, powered by M5 chips, are reportedly nearing mass production with an expected release between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, though no other major changes are anticipated for this immediate release. More significant upgrades are slated for late 2026, which will introduce M6 chips built on a 2nm process. These later models are also rumored to feature an OLED display, a touch screen, a thinner design, and potentially cellular connectivity with a smaller screen notch.</h2>
