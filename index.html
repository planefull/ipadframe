    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks due primarily to "linkability," which allows various credential uses to be associated with a single person, leading to detailed user profiles and potential surveillance. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a new cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively share only necessary information without revealing underlying data or allowing separate interactions to be linked, all without requiring updates to existing credential issuance systems.</h2>
