    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes, failing because they don't know *when* to check, leading to wasted resources or giving up. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended durations, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Delays Home App Update Requirement Until February 2026</h1>
    <h2>Apple has extended the deadline for users to update to the new HomeKit architecture, now ending support for the previous version of Apple Home on February 10, 2026. Users must transition to this updated architecture by the deadline to avoid interruptions with accessories and automations, as the Home app will cease to function on devices running older iOS, iPadOS, and macOS versions. The newer architecture, revamped in March 2023 and now stable, provides enhanced features like guest access, robot vacuum support, and faster, more reliable smart home performance.</h2>
