    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to reliably monitor conditions for hours or days. This innovation, implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and validated through the SentinelBench evaluation suite, significantly improves agent success rates for these persistent tasks, paving the way for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
