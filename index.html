    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast "Ideas" features the Paraphrase Project, which investigated the "dual-use" nature of AI tools for protein design. Researchers discovered that open-source AI could generate toxic protein variants capable of bypassing current biosecurity screening systems, identifying this as a "zero day" vulnerability. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed more robust screening solutions and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for responsibly sharing sensitive research data, aiming to enhance biosecurity while balancing transparency and risk.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Teases Upcoming M5 MacBook Pro Launch: 'Something Powerful is Coming'</h1>
    <h2>Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak teased an upcoming product launch on social media, hinting at an M5 chip with phrases like "something powerful is coming," five "M"s, and a MacBook Pro image forming the Roman numeral 'V'. The M5 chip is expected to debut in a 14-inch MacBook Pro this week, though higher-end M5 Pro and Max models may follow in 2026. Additionally, Apple is rumored to introduce new iPad Pro, Vision Pro, Apple TV, and HomePod mini models, all potentially featuring the M5 chip.</h2>
