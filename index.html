    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form and large-scale visual data, which often requires temporal understanding, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen that uses a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This agent leverages modality-specific tools (e.g., ImageAgent, VideoAgent) and an iterative self-evaluation loop to analyze complex queries across vast video and image libraries, significantly enhancing performance and providing explainable insights.</h2>
