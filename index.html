    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored integrating generative AI to support these professionals in "sensemaking" tasks. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype that flags unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizes gene and variant information from literature, aiming to enhance diagnostic efficiency and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2025 Product Roadmap: What's Still Coming</h1>
    <h2>Despite Apple's major yearly events being concluded, several new products are anticipated to launch before the end of 2025. Expected updates include an Apple TV with an A17 Pro chip, an M5 iPad Pro and Vision Pro, a HomePod mini with an S10 chip, and an AirTag 2 with enhanced tracking capabilities, largely focusing on internal performance improvements. While a new M5 MacBook Pro is also rumored, the exact launch timeline is uncertain, and these products may be unveiled through press releases rather than a dedicated October event.</h2>
