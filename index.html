    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to address the limitations of current AI models in processing long-form video and large-scale image data for complex reasoning tasks. Built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture, MMCTAgent performs iterative, tool-based reasoning, leveraging specialized agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent for structured analysis and refinement. This agentic approach significantly enhances multimodal understanding and question-answering capabilities across extensive visual datasets, as demonstrated by improved performance on benchmark evaluations.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Mac Plans</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning a significant refresh of its Mac lineup throughout 2026, primarily introducing M5 chips across most models, with a possibility of M6 chips appearing by year-end. Updates are expected for the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and Mac Studio, alongside the debut of a new, lower-cost MacBook featuring an A18 Pro chip. Additionally, two new Mac Displays are in development, and a redesigned OLED MacBook Pro with a touchscreen and M6 chip is rumored for late 2026.</h2>
