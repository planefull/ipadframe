    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex technical questions from professional users, grappling with thousands of product models and diverse, multimodal documentation. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, showcasing PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for industrial scenarios.</h2>
