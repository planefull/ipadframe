    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," which explored how AI chatbots like Copilot could assist various occupations, particularly in knowledge work and communication tasks. The authors explicitly stated that their research identifies AI's usefulness in performing subtasks, not its ability to eliminate entire jobs, correcting public misinterpretations. They also highlighted methodological limitations, acknowledging that job complexity extends beyond individual tasks and advocating for AI as a tool to complement human strengths.</h2>

    <h1>From iPhone 17 Air to iPhone 20: Apple's Redesign Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans a complete iPhone design overhaul over the next three years, leading to a radically different "iPhone 20" by 2027. In 2025, the significantly thinner iPhone 17 Air will debut, followed by Apple's first foldable iPhone in 2026, featuring a book-like design with dual displays. The 20th-anniversary iPhone in 2027 is expected to boast an all-glass design with a wraparound, bezel-free display.</h2>
