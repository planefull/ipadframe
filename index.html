    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the overwhelming volume and complexity of whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and prolonged patient suffering. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a generative AI-based assistant to enhance the "sensemaking" tasks inherent in genetic analysis. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic conditions.</h2>
