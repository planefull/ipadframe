    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, such as those used by DNA synthesis companies. A collaborative cross-sector team then developed and implemented robust updates to these screening systems, akin to cybersecurity patches, to detect these AI-generated threats. This effort not only strengthened global biosecurity but also pioneered a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research data in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Facebook's New Collage Feature May Use Your Images for AI Training</h1>
    <h2>Facebook is rolling out a new opt-in AI-based collage and photo editing tool that scans your camera roll to generate suggested edits and collages for sharing. While these AI suggestions remain private until you decide to post them, sharing any such content means your images will be utilized for Meta's AI training. Users in the U.S. and Canada can manage this feature and its camera roll access through Facebook's settings, and those concerned about AI training should avoid enabling it.</h2>
