    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce significant privacy risks like "linkability," allowing various credential uses to be connected and user profiles built. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into widely used formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary information or linking separate interactions, and importantly, without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>
