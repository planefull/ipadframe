    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow distinct credential uses to be associated with an individual, enabling user tracking. Microsoft Research addresses this with Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Using efficient zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent allows users to selectively disclose information and prove facts without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, critically working without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing iOS 18.7 for iPhones as iOS 26 Release Date Nears</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7 in September, an update expected to focus mainly on security fixes. This will be one of the final updates for older models like the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, as they are incompatible with the forthcoming iOS 26. iOS 26 is also nearing its public release around mid-September and will only support iPhone 11 models and newer.</h2>
