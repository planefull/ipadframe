    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," enabling hidden identifiers to track and profile user activities across various applications. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose necessary information without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, notably without requiring changes to existing credential issuance systems.</h2>
