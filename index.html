    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data synthesis, when diagnosing rare genetic diseases using whole genome sequencing, leading to low diagnostic rates. To address this, a collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to enhance their workflows. This AI assistant aims to streamline the process by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped "signing" iOS 18.6.2, along with iPadOS 18.6.2 and tvOS 18.6, meaning users can no longer downgrade from the recently released iOS 26. "Signing" is Apple's server-side verification that prevents the installation of outdated and potentially less secure software versions. Therefore, once an iPhone or iPad has been upgraded to iOS 26, there is no option to revert to iOS 18.</h2>
