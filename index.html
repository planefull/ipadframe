    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces "SentinelStep," a new mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. Integrated into the Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended tasks, paving the way for more proactive and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's A20 Chip Could Be Massively More Expensive</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming A20 chip, slated for next year's iPhone 18 models and expected to be the first widely available 2-nanometer chip, is anticipated to be considerably more expensive. TSMC is reportedly charging at least 50% more for its 2-nanometer processors, which could raise the A20 chip's unit cost to around $280, making it the most expensive iPhone component and potentially impacting Apple's profit margins. As a result, Apple may limit these pricier 2-nanometer chips to only its high-end iPhone 18 Pro models to manage costs.</h2>
