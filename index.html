    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email response or price drop, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Launched Its Big New Vision for TV 10 Years Ago Today</h1>
    <h2>A decade ago, Apple fundamentally transformed its Apple TV platform by launching the Apple TV HD, Siri Remote, and tvOS, signaling a major strategic shift towards an app-centric future for television. This overhaul introduced a dedicated App Store for third-party developers, enabling universal search, and positioning the device as a casual gaming and app platform, powered by the A8 chip and an innovative touch- and voice-controlled Siri Remote. While some aspirations for a Siri-driven gaming ecosystem haven't fully materialized, this launch nevertheless established the core design and functionality that defines the Apple TV experience to this day.</h2>
