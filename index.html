    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, uncovered a critical vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, allowing them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. This discovery, deemed the first "zero day" for AI and biosecurity, prompted a collaborative, cybersecurity-style response to develop and deploy more robust screening patches with synthesis companies like Twist Bioscience. Beyond technical fixes, the project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible sharing of sensitive research data, setting a precedent for handling information hazards in dual-use AI and biotechnology fields.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Liquid Glass Design Copied by Android Smartphone Maker</h1>
    <h2>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has unveiled its new OriginOS 6, which significantly draws inspiration from Apple's "Liquid Glass" design language found in iOS 26. The operating system features a strikingly similar aesthetic, including rounded, translucent elements like buttons, icons, app folders, and notifications, creating an interface that could easily be mistaken for Apple's. Despite Vivo's marketing referencing a "flowing" user experience, the clear visual mimicry of Apple's distinctive design is evident throughout.</h2>
