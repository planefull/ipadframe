    <h1>BlueCodeAgent: A blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming for CodeGen AI</h1>
    <h2>Large language models (LLMs) used for code generation present significant security risks, producing potentially malicious, biased, or vulnerable code, with current defensive mechanisms ("blue teaming") facing several limitations. To address this, researchers developed BlueCodeAgent, a novel blue-teaming framework that strengthens defenses by integrating knowledge derived from diverse automated "red teaming" processes. BlueCodeAgent uses this knowledge to create actionable safety "constitutions" for principled defense and employs dynamic sandbox-based testing for nuanced analysis, significantly improving risk detection, reducing false positives, and enhancing generalization across various code generation risks.</h2>
