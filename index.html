    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing hidden identifiers to track and profile user activities across various applications and services. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing optimized zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent enables users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing any underlying data that could link separate interactions, thereby enhancing privacy without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
