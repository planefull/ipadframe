    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research "Paraphrase Project" investigated how AI-powered protein design tools could be misused to create toxic proteins that evade current biosecurity screening systems, revealing a significant "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team developed a cybersecurity-style response, patching screening tools to make them more AI-resilient and demonstrating their effectiveness on a broad set of hazardous proteins. This effort culminated in a new model for responsible disclosure and data sharing, involving a "perpetual gatekeeping" process to navigate information hazards and enhance global biosecurity in the face of rapidly advancing AI.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV's 'Vibrant' Rebranding Starts to Appear in Latest iOS 26.1 Beta</h1>
    <h2>Apple has announced the rebranding of Apple TV+ to simply "Apple TV," promising a "vibrant new identity" for the service. Hints of this change are already visible in the latest iOS 26.1 and tvOS 26.1 betas, where app icons and visuals have adopted a glass-like multicolor design, replacing the prior subdued gray theme. While the rebrand is evident on Apple's press pages, it has not yet propagated to consumer-focused sites, and it remains to be seen if additional components beyond the name and logo will be part of the update.</h2>
