    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data interpretation, when using whole genome sequencing to diagnose rare diseases, often resulting in low initial diagnosis rates. A study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored integrating generative AI to streamline these intensive sensemaking tasks. They co-designed an AI assistant to help by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce the time to diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has withdrawn most of its claims against Apple regarding a 2021 email from CEO Tim Cook. Cook's email warned employees about leaking confidential information, stating that such individuals "do not belong at Apple," and followed a leaked company meeting. The NLRB had initially accused Apple of violating U.S. labor law by imposing confidentiality rules and surveilling workers, but is now dropping these accusations.</h2>
