    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>This article clarifies previous research, explaining that their study identified occupations where generative AI chatbots could be useful for specific tasks, especially in knowledge work and communication. The authors emphasize that their research does not conclude that AI will eliminate jobs, explicitly cautioning against such interpretations. Instead, the paper highlights AI's potential as a tool to assist with subtasks, while acknowledging the limitations of focusing solely on tasks and user queries.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Similar to the iPhone 4 bumper, this accessory would cover only the device's edges, providing protection without adding significant bulk. Furthermore, there are also rumors that Apple plans to release a battery case for the iPhone 17 Air.</h2>
