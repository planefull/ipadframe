    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to vast, complex product documentation that traditional RAG systems struggled to process. To overcome this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology, integrating it into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This specialized RAG approach, capable of understanding multimodal content, utilizing original documents, and performing multi-hop reasoning, resulted in a significant 12% improvement in answer accuracy for Signify, validating its effectiveness for complex industrial knowledge management.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, New York, will reopen on Friday, November 21, after extensive renovations, featuring a new modern design with more wood paneling. The store has been closed for approximately a year during the revamp, with a temporary location serving customers in the interim. This reopening is part of a larger initiative, as Apple is also renovating several other U.S. stores and recently completed projects in Texas and Australia.</h2>
