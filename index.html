    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check conditions, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in Magentic-UI that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for monitoring tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and always-on intelligent assistants.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Giving Vision Pro Another Chance</h1>
    <h2>The latest episode of The MacRumors Show dives into the new Apple Vision Pro, which features an M5 chip and arrives 20 months after its predecessor. This updated headset offers enhanced performance, a better display with up to 120Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, a more comfortable headband, and new visionOS 26 features like widgets and improved Personas. The podcast discusses how much better the new version is and whether it's finally time to reconsider Apple's spatial computing device.</h2>
