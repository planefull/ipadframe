    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis, which hinder accurate and timely diagnosis of rare genetic diseases from whole genome sequencing data. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed a generative AI assistant prototype to address these issues by streamlining "sensemaking" tasks. This AI tool is designed to flag unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information from scientific literature, ultimately aiming to increase diagnostic yield and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models, featuring M5 chips, are reportedly nearing mass production according to Mark Gurman, with a release expected between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. These initial models are not rumored to have major design changes beyond the updated processors. However, more significant upgrades are anticipated in late 2026, including an OLED touch screen, a thinner design, M6 chips, and potentially cellular connectivity.</h2>
