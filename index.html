    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form and large-scale visual data, which demands complex temporal and cross-modal reasoning beyond their current capabilities. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, designed for structured reasoning over extensive video and image collections. MMCTAgent utilizes a Planner-Critic architecture and modality-specific agents with specialized tools to perform iterative reasoning, significantly improving performance on benchmarks by enabling planning, reflection, and tool-based analysis for accurate and explainable insights.</h2>
