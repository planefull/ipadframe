    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases from whole genome sequencing data, encountering information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, which leads to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant prototype to support their complex sensemaking tasks. This AI assistant aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on emerging scientific evidence and efficiently aggregating and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and accelerating rare disease diagnoses.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is accelerating development of its smart glasses to compete with Meta, even pausing work on the next Vision Pro to prioritize getting them to market. These fashion-forward glasses will heavily rely on a next-generation, AI-powered Siri for voice controls and advanced features like visual intelligence, photography, and communication, though the first generation will lack a display. Expected to be announced in late 2026 for an early 2027 launch, the glasses will require an iPhone for full functionality and AI processing.</h2>
