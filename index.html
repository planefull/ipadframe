    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, integrated into their Magentic-UI system. This innovation enables agents to reliably monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving success rates on long-duration tasks and paving the way for more practical, proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>New Version of Siri to 'Lean' on Google Gemini</h1>
    <h2>Mark Gurman reports that Apple plans to launch a significantly revamped Siri around March next year, which will be powered by a custom Google Gemini model running on Apple's Private Cloud Compute. This new Siri will be accompanied by a new smart home display, Apple TV, and HomePod mini, with 2026 operating system updates focusing heavily on Apple Intelligence. However, challenges include potential user skepticism, past brand damage for Siri, and ongoing regulatory delays for Apple Intelligence's launch in China.</h2>
