    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, co-led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team then developed an AI "red-teaming" pipeline to demonstrate this risk and subsequently created and shared "patches" to strengthen these screening systems globally. This effort not only significantly improved AI-resilient biosecurity but also established a new "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of dual-use scientific information, highlighting the ongoing need for vigilance and adaptive governance in the age of AI.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple may be planning to release an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, hinted by a notice on its visionOS resources page. The accessory is expected to be available again starting Wednesday, October 22, which aligns with the release of the Vision Pro featuring the new M5 chip. While specifics on new features, pricing, or compatibility are unknown, the update likely addresses the original strap's limitation to USB 2.0 speeds.</h2>
