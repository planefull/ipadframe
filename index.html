    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, in ways that bypassed existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. This discovery, identified as the first "zero day" in AI biosecurity, led to a collaborative, cybersecurity-style response that developed "patches" for screening tools and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible disclosure of sensitive research. The project significantly strengthened global biosecurity against AI-enabled threats, demonstrating a crucial model for proactively addressing dual-use dilemmas and emphasizing the need for continuous, layered defense strategies as AI capabilities in biology advance.</h2>
