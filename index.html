    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, despite their convenience, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be tracked and associated with an individual, even with existing selective disclosure features. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices, to prevent linking separate digital interactions and protect user privacy without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
