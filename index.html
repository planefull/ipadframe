    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and associate a user's separate digital activities. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for efficiency through preprocessing, to allow users to selectively prove facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or enabling their interactions to be linked, all while being compatible with existing identity systems.</h2>
