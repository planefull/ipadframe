    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficient resource usage or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Implemented in Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are reporting a static-like, hissing, or ocean-like sound when Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive, or Transparency modes are active, according to complaints on Reddit and MacRumors forums. This audible noise can make it difficult to listen to music at low volumes and is sometimes described as amplifying higher frequencies. While Apple is reportedly exchanging affected units, some users have experienced the same issue with replacement pairs, and it remains unclear if the problem is hardware or software related.</h2>
