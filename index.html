    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to information overload and low initial diagnosis rates for genetic professionals. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed and prototyped a generative AI-based assistant. This AI assistant is designed to streamline analysis by flagging unsolved cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data from scientific literature, aiming to increase diagnostic yields and improve patient outcomes.</h2>
