    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data analysis, in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing, leading to low diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute studied and co-designed a generative AI assistant to enhance genetic professionals' workflows. This AI tool aims to streamline data synthesis, prioritize cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and foster collaborative sensemaking, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis for rare diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is accelerating development of smart glasses to rival Meta Ray-Bans, even halting work on the next Vision Pro to prioritize their launch in late 2026 or early 2027. These fashion-forward glasses will integrate a powerful, AI-driven Siri for voice controls, enabling features like taking photos, playing audio, translation, and identifying objects. While they won't include a display in the first generation and will require an iPhone connection for processing, they aim to offer competitive AI, camera, and audio capabilities.</h2>
