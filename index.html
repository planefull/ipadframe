    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check for conditions, leading to wasted resources or task failure. Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a new mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to complete monitoring tasks lasting hours or days. Integrated into the Magentic-UI agentic system, SentinelStep significantly improves task reliability and resource efficiency for these extended durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and patient AI assistants.</h2>
