    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast episode discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated the dual-use nature of AI-powered protein design, revealing that AI tools could create novel toxic proteins capable of bypassing existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers from Microsoft, IBBIS, and Twist Bioscience demonstrated this vulnerability by generating AI-rewritten versions of toxic proteins that went undetected by current safeguards. This led to a "cybersecurity-style" response, resulting in the development and global implementation of more robust, AI-resilient screening solutions and a new perpetual gatekeeping strategy for handling sensitive dual-use information in scientific publications.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Apple Nearing Agreement With EU Over App Store Rules</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly nearing a settlement with the European Commission to resolve multiple antitrust investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to prevent substantial daily fines. These investigations primarily focus on Apple's App Store rules, where the company was previously fined â‚¬500 million for violating anti-steering provisions by restricting developers from directing users to offers outside its platform. While Apple has introduced modifications like allowing alternative payment options and external app distribution, discussions are ongoing to ensure its new contractual terms achieve full compliance with the DMA's fair competition requirements.</h2>
