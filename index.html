    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents fail at long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability and success rates for extended monitoring durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
