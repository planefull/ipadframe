    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with long-form video and large image collections, lacking the temporal and cross-modal reasoning needed for real-world tasks. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture. This agent allows for structured, iterative reasoning by employing modality-specific tools, evaluating intermediate results, and refining conclusions, significantly enhancing accuracy and providing explainable insights over vast visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>According to a *Financial Times* report, Apple is intensifying preparations for CEO Tim Cook to step down as early as next year, with the board and senior executives focused on a smooth leadership transition. While no final decisions have been made, John Ternus, Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, is widely considered the most likely successor. However, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman disputes the report's claim of an imminent change, and Apple's succession plans are unrelated to the company's current record-breaking financial performance.</h2>
