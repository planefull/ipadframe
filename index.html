    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative analysis. To overcome this, Microsoft Research introduced MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This agentic framework enables structured, iterative reasoning across diverse visual data, utilizing specialized tools and feedback loops to significantly enhance performance on complex visual question-answering and content inspection tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h1>
    <h2>According to the Financial Times, Apple is preparing for CEO Tim Cook to step down as early as next year, with the board intensifying preparations for a smooth leadership transition. John Ternus, Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, is widely viewed as Cook's most likely successor. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman disputes the report's immediacy, and Apple's current strong financial performance indicates that succession plans are not related to company performance.</h2>
