    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled with its knowledge management system to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex technical inquiries due to vast, multimodal product data. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling better parsing of multimodal documents, ensuring end-to-end knowledge loops, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex questions.</h2>
