    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. SentinelStep dynamically adjusts polling frequency and manages context overflow, significantly improving task reliability over extended durations by saving agent state and intelligently determining check intervals.</h2>

    <h1>New Version of Siri to 'Lean' on Google Gemini</h1>
    <h2>According to Mark Gurman's "Power On" newsletter, Apple is planning to roll out a revamped Siri around March 2026, which will leverage a custom Google Gemini-based model for AI-powered web search and other features. This update will coincide with new hardware releases, including a smart home display, Apple TV, and HomePod mini, all designed to showcase the new Siri and Apple Intelligence capabilities. While major AI-focused updates are anticipated for iOS 27 and other operating systems, Gurman cautions about potential user adoption challenges and ongoing regulatory issues that are delaying Apple Intelligence's launch in China.</h2>
