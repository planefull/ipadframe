    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for an email or a price drop, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Integrated into the Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Vision Pro Now Made in Vietnam</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new Vision Pro, equipped with the M5 chip, is now assembled in Vietnam, signaling a significant shift away from its previous manufacturing in China. This move is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its production, with most AirPods, Apple Watches, iPads, and HomePods now made in Vietnam, and many iPhone 17 models for the US market coming from India. Apple is further expanding its supply chain to include Thailand and Malaysia for Macs, while also planning US manufacturing for iPhone and Apple Watch cover glass.</h2>
