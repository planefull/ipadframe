    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI," which studied where generative AI, like Bing Copilot, might be useful in different occupations, finding it most applicable to knowledge-based and communication tasks such as writing and information gathering. The authors explicitly stated that their research does not conclude or suggest that AI will eliminate jobs, a common misinterpretation they aim to correct. Instead, the paper identifies AI's potential to assist with or perform specific subtasks, emphasizing the importance of nuanced understanding and acknowledging the limitations of its methodology in capturing the full scope of human jobs.</h2>

    <h1>From iPhone 17 Air to iPhone 20: Apple's Redesign Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans a complete redesign of the iPhone over the next three years, leading to a radically different "iPhone 20" for its 20th anniversary in 2027. The first step in 2025 will be the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, followed by the debut of the first foldable iPhone in 2026, which will feature both an outer and larger inner display. Finally, the 2027 anniversary model is envisioned as an all-glass device with a wraparound display, completely devoid of bezels or cutouts.</h2>
