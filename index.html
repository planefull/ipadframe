    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate uses of credentials to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information without revealing any underlying data that could enable tracking, all without requiring updates to credential issuing organizations' systems.</h2>
