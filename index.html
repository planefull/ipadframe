    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, revealing that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, a vulnerability termed a "zero day." This discovery led to a rapid, cross-sector collaboration between Microsoft Research, industry partners like Twist Bioscience, and organizations such as IBBIS, to develop and deploy "patches" for more robust biosecurity screening methods. The project successfully strengthened defenses against AI-enabled biological threats and pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible scientific disclosure of sensitive dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Liquid Glass Design Copied by Android Smartphone Maker</h1>
    <h2>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has unveiled OriginOS 6, its latest operating system update, which heavily borrows from Apple's Liquid Glass design language seen in iOS 26. The new OS features rounded buttons, translucent glass effects, squircle icons, and shifting wallpapers, making its interface easily mistaken for Apple's. Despite Vivo's marketing referencing water-like fluidity, the clear influence of Apple's aesthetic is undeniable in OriginOS 6's visual presentation.</h2>
