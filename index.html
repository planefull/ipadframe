    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check for specific conditions, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that integrates dynamic polling and careful context management into agent workflows. This allows agents to effectively monitor conditions for extended periods, significantly improving their reliability for longer tasks and paving the way for more proactive and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Microsoft Edge 'Copilot Mode' Brings More AI to Your Browser Tabs</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft has launched new features for its AI "Copilot Mode" in the Edge browser, building on its initial chat interface that allows users to ask questions, search, and analyze content across multiple tabs. Two new preview features, "Copilot Actions" and "Journeys," are rolling out to U.S. users, offering agentic capabilities like task automation and voice commands, alongside thematic organization of browsing history. This move places Microsoft Edge firmly in the competitive race among tech companies to integrate advanced AI into their browser products.</h2>
