    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could "paraphrase" toxic proteins, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed an AI biosecurity "red-teaming" pipeline to identify these vulnerabilities and created updated, more robust screening systems that were then shared worldwide. This effort established a novel framework for responsible disclosure of dual-use AI research, balancing open science with mitigating information hazards through a perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive data and methods.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is slated to introduce a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, which is expected to offer advanced capabilities such as on-screen awareness and personal context. However, Mark Gurman reports that some Apple software engineers are concerned about the overhauled Siri's performance. Apple has approximately five to six months until the anticipated March or April release of iOS 26.4 to address these issues, as the full debut of the new Siri has already been delayed once before.</h2>
