    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, discovering that open-source AI tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, representing the first "zero-day" vulnerability in AI and biosecurity. A cross-sector team then collaborated to develop and implement AI-resilient screening solutions, which were shared globally with DNA synthesis companies. This effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive research details, setting a new standard for managing information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple appears to be planning the release of an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, with availability coinciding with the launch of the new Vision Pro featuring the M5 chip on October 22. This optional accessory, first released in February 2024, enables a USB-C connection between the Vision Pro and a Mac for app development and diagnostic purposes. While specific new features or changes are unclear, the current strap is noted for being limited to USB 2.0 speeds despite potential Thunderbolt support.</h2>
