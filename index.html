    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tied back to an individual and enabling comprehensive tracking. To combat this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs, including a two-stage process for mobile devices, to enable selective disclosure and prevent credential presentations from being linked, all without requiring credential issuers to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has significantly discounted the MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, offering it for $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, down from the original $99. This reduced price covers all remaining live and on-demand matches, playoffs, and features like "MLS 360" and "Sunday Night Soccer." While a strategic move consistent with past years, the annual subscription will automatically renew at the standard $99 price for the 2026 season unless manually canceled.</h2>
