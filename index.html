    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," which allows separate uses of credentials to be associated with a specific person and build detailed user profiles. To counter this, Microsoft Research has introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose information without revealing any data that could link their distinct digital interactions, and integrates with existing systems without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Rivian Activates Apple Car Key Support in Second-Generation Vehicles</h1>
    <h2>EV manufacturer Rivian is finally activating support for Apple's digital car keys through the Wallet app on iPhone and Apple Watch, a feature it had announced over a year ago. This integration enables owners to unlock their vehicles using their devices via NFC or Ultra Wideband, offering a more seamless experience with features like key sharing. While Rivian still does not support CarPlay, this rollout joins Apple Music integration as another Apple feature adopted by the company.</h2>
