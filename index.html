    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to efficiently manage polling frequency and avoid context overflow over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that embeds patience into agent workflows using dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing agents to effectively monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks and is open-sourced to enable proactive, efficient, and resource-aware agent development.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's iPhone Air Experiment Fails as Supply Chain Cuts Production by 80%</h1>
    <h2>Apple's iPhone Air has reportedly failed to meet sales expectations, prompting the company's supply chain to drastically scale back production and shipments. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suppliers are expected to reduce capacity by over 80% as the iPhone 17 and Pro models already satisfy the majority of high-end user demand. This poor performance reflects a broader struggle for super-thin smartphones, including Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, and continues Apple's history of difficulty with experimental fourth-spot iPhone models like the mini and Plus.</h2>
