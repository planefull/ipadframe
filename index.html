    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to overcome existing multimodal AI limitations in analyzing long-form video and large image collections, which often require complex reasoning beyond simple object recognition. Built on Microsoft's AutoGen, MMCTAgent uses a Planner-Critic architecture with modality-specific agents (ImageAgent and VideoAgent) and specialized tools to perform iterative, deliberate reasoning. This framework enables structured ingestion, retrieval, and refinement of information, significantly enhancing performance and providing explainable, scalable insights for diverse real-world applications.</h2>
