    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research *Ideas* podcast episode highlights the "Paraphrase Project," which discovered that AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, to bypass current biosecurity screening systems, creating a "zero day" vulnerability. This led to a cross-sector effort involving Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS to develop AI-resilient screening solutions and "patches" that were subsequently shared globally with DNA synthesis companies. Beyond technical fixes, the project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research data and methods, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Does Not Include a Charger in the Box in Europe</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip will not include a charger in the box for customers in European countries, including the U.K., Germany, and France. In contrast, U.S. and other non-European customers will still receive a 70W USB-C Power Adapter, though European buyers will get a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable. Apple attributes this decision to its environmental goals, a practice it has gradually implemented across various products, including recent AirPods.</h2>
