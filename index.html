    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to design a generative AI-based assistant to support these professionals. This AI tool is intended to streamline the interpretation process by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yields and reduce the time to diagnosis.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Challenges EU Digital Markets Act Over Feature Delays</h1>
    <h2>Apple is urging European regulators to scrap the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming it has created security vulnerabilities, damaged the user experience, and caused at least three product features to be postponed. The company asserts that the DMA has exposed EU users to malware and explicit content through third-party app stores, and has delayed features like iPhone Mirroring and Live Translation due to privacy-based engineering challenges. Apple argues that these compliance efforts consume thousands of engineering hours while delivering inferior results and enabling data harvesting by rival firms, rather than boosting competition.</h2>
