    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project identified a critical "zero day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade current biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft and Twist Bioscience, then collaboratively developed and deployed more robust, AI-resilient screening "patches" to detect these subtly altered sequences. This effort not only strengthened biosecurity against generative protein design but also established a novel framework for responsible disclosure and ongoing management of sensitive research data to navigate the dual-use challenges of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming second-generation smart glasses, equipped with an in-lens display, are rumored to feature two operating modes based on the connected device. According to Mark Gurman, these glasses could run a full version of visionOS when paired with a Mac, and a more lightweight interface when connected to an iPhone. The first-generation Apple smart glasses, expected to launch in 2027 without an in-lens display, will instead offer features like speakers, cameras, and voice control.</h2>
