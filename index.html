    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to overcome current AI limitations in complex reasoning over long-form video and large image collections, which traditional models struggle to process. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent uses a Planner-Critic architecture, enabling iterative reasoning, tool-based analysis, and self-evaluation to refine answers for factual accuracy and consistency. This system features specialized agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent that integrate structured ingestion, retrieval, and fine-grained visual tools, significantly enhancing performance on multimodal benchmarks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Intelligence Apparently Too Smart for M1 Macs After Listing Error</h1>
    <h2>Apple's U.S. website for Apple Intelligence has been updated to list M2 or later Mac models as compatible, causing confusion by seemingly dropping support for M1 Macs. However, regional Apple sites (UK, Canada) and its support page still show M1 Macs as compatible, indicating a discrepancy. This change on the U.S. site is believed to be an erroneous edit made while updating Vision Pro compatibility and is expected to be corrected soon.</h2>
