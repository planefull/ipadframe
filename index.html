    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, often struggling with information overload and lengthy reanalysis processes, which leads to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant after identifying key obstacles through empirical research with experts. This AI tool is designed to enhance diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing crucial genetic and variant information from literature, fostering better expert-AI collaboration.</h2>
