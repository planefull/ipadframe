    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The research identified challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis in whole genome sequencing. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has withdrawn most claims against Apple regarding a 2021 email from CEO Tim Cook that warned employees about leaking confidential information. The NLRB had previously accused Cook of violating U.S. labor law, arguing that Apple's anti-leak rules interfered with employee rights, particularly as the email followed a leaked internal meeting on topics like pay equity. This withdrawal effectively ends the federal labor agency's case concerning the email and related confidentiality rules.</h2>
