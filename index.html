    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, leading to low diagnostic rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant based on expert feedback. This AI tool is designed to flag cases for reanalysis when new scientific findings emerge and to synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to boost diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic conditions.</h2>
