    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to information overload, difficulties in collaborative sharing, and problems prioritizing reanalysis of whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data and flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings. This AI-human collaboration aims to improve diagnostic yield, reduce the time to diagnosis, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for patients with rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Breaks Calendar Search for Some iPhone Users</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 has introduced a bug that breaks search functionality in the Calendar app for some iPhone users across various models. This issue, which surfaced during beta testing and persists in the iOS 26.1 beta, prevents affected users from finding existing calendar events, though it's not universal and can be hit-or-miss. Apple is aware of the problem and plans to address it in a future software update.</h2>
