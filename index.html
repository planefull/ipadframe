    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and profile users across different credential uses. To counter this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or connecting separate interactions, all while being compatible with existing issuer systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says 11-Inch MacBook Air and Two Other Macs Are Now Obsolete</h1>
    <h2>Apple has added three Mac models, including the 11-inch MacBook Air (Early 2015) and two 2017 MacBook Pro variants, to its obsolete products list. A product becomes obsolete seven years after its distribution ends, making it generally ineligible for repairs from Apple or authorized service providers. Additionally, specific iPhone 8 Plus models were moved to the vintage list, which means repairs are still possible for up to two more years before they become obsolete.</h2>
