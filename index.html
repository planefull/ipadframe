    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate technical answers to professional users from its extensive and complex product documentation. To overcome this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This advanced RAG solution significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% by effectively parsing multimodal documents, ensuring an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods 4 Drop to $89.99 Record Low Price on Amazon</h1>
    <h2>Apple's AirPods 4 (base model) are currently on sale for a record-low price of $89.99 on Amazon, a significant drop from their original $129. This is the lowest price ever tracked for this model, which does not include Active Noise Cancellation. While the ANC-equipped AirPods 4 are also discounted to $149.99, the article recommends waiting for a steeper discount on that version, and free delivery options are available.</h2>
