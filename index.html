    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed Magentic Marketplace, an open-source simulation environment, to explore the complex dynamics and societal implications of autonomous AI agents in economic markets. This platform enables studying multi-agent interactions, which is crucial for understanding real-world deployments and addressing concerns like consumer welfare, fairness, and manipulation resistance. Initial experiments showed that while agents can improve consumer welfare with good discovery, they are also vulnerable to manipulation, struggle with too many options (the "paradox of choice"), and exhibit systemic biases, highlighting the need for careful market design and oversight.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2 Beta 1 for iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and Cellular M5 iPad Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing the first developer betas of iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 for the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and cellular M5 iPad Pro, preventing these devices from installing the update. The exact reason is unknown, but it's suspected to be a bug related to Apple's new custom C1 or C1X cellular chips, common to all affected models. Users with these devices will find installation attempts fail, and revised developer betas are expected once Apple addresses the issue.</h2>
