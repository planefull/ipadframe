    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing various uses of a person's digital credentials to be tracked and profiled. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses, enhancing user privacy without requiring infrastructure updates. Crescent achieves this by employing zero-knowledge SNARKs in an efficient two-stage process, enabling users to prove specific facts about their credentials while ensuring no information beyond what is explicitly shared can link their separate digital interactions.</h2>
