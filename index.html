    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as waiting for emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. SentinelStep dynamically adjusts polling intervals and prevents context overflow, significantly improving task reliability over extended durations and laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
