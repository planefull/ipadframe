    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for conditions, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow, significantly improving the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, as demonstrated by their SentinelBench evaluation.</h2>
