    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data for rare disease diagnosis, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute studied how generative AI could support these complex sensemaking tasks. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize critical gene and variant information, aiming to boost diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare genetic diseases.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is accelerating the development of fashion-forward smart glasses to compete with Meta's offering, even pausing work on the next Vision Pro to prioritize their release. These glasses will heavily rely on a next-generation Siri for voice-based controls, enabling features like photography, audio playback, navigation, and visual intelligence, though they won't include a display. Expected to be announced in late 2026 for an early 2027 launch, the glasses will require an iPhone connection for AI processing and other functionalities.</h2>
