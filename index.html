    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast *Ideas* features discussions about the Paraphrase Project, which revealed that AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, creating a "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, then developed a more robust, AI-resilient protein screening system and successfully shared these "patches" with the nucleic acid synthesis industry. This collaborative effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data and software sharing to mitigate information hazards in dual-use research, aiming to set a new standard for balancing open science with global safety.</h2>

    <h1>Some Apple Employees Have 'Concerns' About iOS 26.4's Revamped Siri</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26.4 is expected to introduce a revamped Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, but some Apple software engineers reportedly have "concerns" about its performance. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, these unspecified shortcomings are being discussed despite the new Siri's promised advanced capabilities, such as on-screen awareness and personal context. Although Apple has several months before its anticipated March or April release to resolve these issues, persistent problems could lead to a further delay in the voice assistant's launch.</h2>
