    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, including information overload and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, which leads to prolonged diagnostic journeys for patients. A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute explored integrating generative AI to enhance these complex sensemaking tasks. They designed an AI assistant prototype that can flag unsolved cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently aggregate and synthesize gene and variant information, aiming to boost diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>
