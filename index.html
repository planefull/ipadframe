    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a "zero day" vulnerability where AI protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed "patches" that strengthened global nucleic acid synthesis screening capabilities to detect these AI-generated variants. This effort also established a novel, perpetually managed disclosure process for sensitive dual-use research, underscoring the ongoing need for vigilance and collaboration in managing AI's impact on biosecurity.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV's 'Vibrant' Rebranding Starts to Appear in Latest iOS 26.1 Beta</h1>
    <h2>Apple TV+ is being rebranded to "Apple TV" with a "vibrant new identity," as hinted by an earlier announcement. The first visible changes include new glasslike, multicolor app icons and visuals replacing the previous gray theme, appearing in the latest iOS 26.1 and tvOS 26.1 betas. While this rebrand is already present on press pages, it has not yet reached consumer-focused sites, and further rebranding components may still be revealed.</h2>
