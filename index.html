    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>A collaborative study by Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute addresses the complex and time-consuming challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases using whole genome sequencing. They developed a generative AI assistant designed to enhance these workflows by helping manage and synthesize vast amounts of genetic data. This AI aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and aggregating critical gene and variant information.</h2>

    <h1>EU Has 'No Intention' to Repeal DMA Following Apple Challenge</h1>
    <h2>The European Commission has firmly stated its "no intention" of repealing the Digital Markets Act (DMA), despite Apple's ongoing challenges and complaints. Apple argues the DMA jeopardizes EU iPhone users' security and privacy, forces delays in new features, and has urged its repeal or an independent review of its impact. However, the EC maintains that the DMA does not mandate lower privacy or security standards, and has already fined Apple for previous non-compliance.</h2>
