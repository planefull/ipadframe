    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form video and large image libraries due to limitations in temporal context and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, designed for structured reasoning over extensive visual data. MMCTAgent uses a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized agents for images and videos, enabling iterative, tool-based reasoning that significantly enhances accuracy, explainability, and scalability compared to single-pass models.</h2>

    <h1>Here's When Tesla is Expected to Add Support for Apple CarPlay</h1>
    <h2>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Tesla plans to add Apple CarPlay support to its vehicles "in the coming months," marking a significant development for the system. This decision represents a stunning reversal for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who have historically ignored customer requests for CarPlay integration. Tesla will reportedly offer the regular, wireless version of CarPlay, appearing within a window in its existing software, not the more advanced CarPlay Ultra.</h2>
