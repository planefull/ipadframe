    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI-powered tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, allowing them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then collaborated to develop and implement "patches"—more robust screening tools—which have been shared globally to strengthen biosecurity. This pioneering effort demonstrates a cybersecurity-style approach to AI-related risks in biology, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance, proactive defense, and new strategies for responsible information sharing to manage AI's dual-use potential.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Foldable iPhone Could Be Cheaper Than Expected</h1>
    <h2>According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's long-rumored foldable iPhone may cost less to manufacture than previously expected due to significant reductions in hinge component pricing. The hinge's average selling price is now projected at $70-$80, down from $100-$120+, attributed to assembly design optimization and Foxconn's influence through a joint venture with Taiwanese hinge maker Shin Zu Shing. This cost saving could either improve Apple's profit margins or allow for more aggressive pricing to compete in the foldable smartphone market when the device is expected to launch in late 2026.</h2>
