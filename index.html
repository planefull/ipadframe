    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to wait intelligently, either giving up too soon or wasting resources through constant checking. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
