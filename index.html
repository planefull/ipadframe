    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow over hours or days. Implemented in the Magentic-UI prototype and validated with the new SentinelBench evaluation suite, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring, laying the groundwork for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Canva Relaunches Affinity as Free All-in-One Design App</h1>
    <h2>Canva has relaunched its Affinity design suite, consolidating its previously separate vector, photo, and layout tools into a single, free app for Mac and Windows. The new "Affinity by Canva" unifies these capabilities into one interface but now requires a free Canva account, with premium subscribers gaining access to AI tools. This strategic move aims to rival Adobe by offering a robust free core app, though its freemium approach and mandatory Canva integration represent a significant change for existing users.</h2>
