    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing hidden identifiers to track and profile user behavior across various credential uses, even with selective disclosure features. Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses to prevent this tracking. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs, optimized for mobile devices through preprocessing, to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, all without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple has appealed the latest court order in its lawsuit with Epic Games, arguing that the mandate preventing it from collecting any fees on purchases made through external App Store links is unconstitutional and an overreach. This ruling came after Epic protested Apple's initial 12-27% fees for such links, leading the judge to expand the injunction to prohibit all fees and design control. Apple contends that this expanded order improperly modifies the original injunction, violates its rights to intellectual property compensation and free speech, and is too broad by applying to all developers rather than just Epic.</h2>
