    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse documentation, leading to limitations in their traditional knowledge management system. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based system. This collaboration resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling the system to understand multimodal content, rely on original documents, and perform multi-hop reasoning, showcasing PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial scenarios.</h2>

    <h2>Apple's AirPods 4 are currently available on Amazon for $89.00, down from $129.00. This price matches the lowest ever tracked for the base model, which does not include Active Noise Cancellation. While free delivery is expected by November 14th, Prime members may receive same-day delivery, and the article also highlights a less significant discount on the ANC model and links to other Black Friday Apple deals.</h2>
