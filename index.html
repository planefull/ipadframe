    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, faced challenges in efficiently delivering accurate technical answers to professional users due to their extensive and complex product documentation, which included multimodal data like charts and tables. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system, built on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system, capable of multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and multi-hop reasoning, significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% by better understanding complex engineering contexts and diverse data sources.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Store at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York, is reopening on Friday, November 21, following extensive renovations that will introduce a modern design with more wood paneling. This store had been closed for approximately a year, with a temporary location serving customers during that time. Apple is also undertaking similar renovation and relocation projects at several other stores across the U.S. and recently completed work on a store in Australia.</h2>
