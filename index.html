    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, due to limitations in temporal reasoning and single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This system, with specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components, enhances base LLM performance by integrating perception tools and a reflective feedback loop, enabling scalable and explainable analysis of extensive visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Another Designer Leaves Apple</h1>
    <h2>Abidur Chowdhury, a rising star designer known for introducing the iPhone Air, has left Apple to join an AI startup, a move that reportedly caused internal "waves." His departure was unrelated to the iPhone Air's sales performance. This follows a trend of high-profile designers leaving Apple since Jony Ive's departure, and comes shortly after former operations chief Jeff Williams, who oversaw product design, retired, leaving the design team to report directly to CEO Tim Cook.</h2>
