    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its recent paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," to correct misunderstandings about its scope and conclusions regarding AI and jobs. The study analyzed Bing Copilot usage to identify where generative AI could assist various occupations, finding it most useful for knowledge work and communication tasks like writing and gathering information. Crucially, the research explicitly stated it *did not* conclude that AI would lead to job elimination, but rather focused on identifying its utility as a tool to assist with subtasks, emphasizing that a job encompasses more than just individual tasks.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3: Four Key Design Changes Anticipated</h1>
    <h2>Apple is anticipated to launch the AirPods Pro 3 in Fall 2025, likely alongside the iPhone 17, introducing new features such as heart rate monitoring and several design modifications. Key design changes, influenced by the AirPods 4, include a smaller charging case, a hidden capacitive pairing button, a more discreet status light, and a redesigned earpiece with a shorter stem. Furthermore, all AirPods Pro models will gain new software capabilities via iOS 26, such as auto-pausing audio when falling asleep, camera remote functionality, and improved call quality.</h2>
