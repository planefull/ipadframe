    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading lighting company, faced challenges providing accurate and efficient technical answers due to vast, complex, and multimodal product documentation, which traditional AI systems struggled to process. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Azure. This advanced RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% through multimodal document parsing, direct use of original data sources, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries, enhancing customer service and demonstrating its broad applicability across industries.</h2>
