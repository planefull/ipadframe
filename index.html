    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Autonomous AI agents are set to transform the economy, but understanding their complex interactions and societal impacts in digital marketplaces is crucial yet challenging. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced "Magentic Marketplace," an open-source simulation environment designed for studying multi-agent market dynamics at scale. Experiments using this platform revealed that while advanced agents can improve consumer welfare by bridging information gaps, they also demonstrate vulnerabilities to manipulation, a "paradox of choice" where more options don't guarantee better outcomes, and systemic biases that could create unfair market conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2 Beta 1 for iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and Cellular M5 iPad Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing the first developer betas of iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 for the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and cellular M5 iPad Pro models. This is likely due to a bug identified with Apple's new C1 or C1X custom cellular chips, as an update attempt reportedly forced one iPad Pro into recovery mode. As a result, affected devices can no longer install these updates, which have been fully pulled, until Apple releases revised betas addressing the issue.</h2>
