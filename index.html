    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases, which currently faces challenges like information overload and slow reanalysis of whole genome sequencing data. They co-designed a prototype AI assistant to address these issues by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information. This AI-enhanced approach aims to improve diagnostic yield, shorten the time to diagnosis, and enhance patient outcomes by fostering effective human-AI collaboration in complex genetic analysis.</h2>
