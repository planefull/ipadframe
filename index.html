    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast *Ideas* explores the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design and its impact on biosecurity. Researchers discovered that AI tools could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, making them undetectable by existing DNA synthesis screening systems, a vulnerability dubbed the first "zero day" in AI biosecurity. A cross-sector team developed red-teaming approaches, created and implemented "patches" to strengthen screening, and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" method for responsible data sharing to mitigate future risks while promoting open science.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to launch M5 MacBook Air models in spring 2026, with M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models arriving earlier that year, focusing primarily on chip upgrades without immediate design changes. A more significant refresh for the MacBook Pro is expected in late 2026 or early 2027, introducing thinner, lighter OLED models with touch screen capabilities. Additionally, Apple is developing M5-equipped Mac Studio and Mac mini models, along with new external displays, though their specific launch dates remain unannounced.</h2>
