    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate answers to complex professional inquiries due to vast product data and diverse technical documentation, a challenge even for traditional RAG systems. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This collaboration resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy, achieved by PIKE-RAG's ability to parse multimodal documents, establish an end-to-end knowledge loop, and perform dynamic multi-hop reasoning for precise, context-aware responses.</h2>

    <h1>Nomad Launches Find My-Compatible Tracking Card Pro</h1>
    <h2>Nomad has launched its new Tracking Card Pro, a Find My-compatible item tracker designed to blend seamlessly into a wallet with its credit card-like appearance. This device offers a significant upgrade with up to 16 months of battery life and supports Qi/MagSafe wireless charging, surpassing its predecessor. Functioning similarly to an AirTag, it utilizes the Apple Find My network for location tracking, sound alerts, and left-behind notifications, though it lacks Ultra Wideband for Precision Finding.</h2>
