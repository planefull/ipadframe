    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that allows agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants, and is now available as open-source.</h2>
