    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The rise of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is leading to a "society of agents" and tools where disparate systems must cooperate, moving beyond vertically integrated designs. However, this horizontal integration introduces "tool-space interference," manifesting as performance degradation from too many tools or lengthy responses, naming collisions, complex parameters, and poor error handling, as revealed by a survey of MCP servers. To address these challenges, the article proposes recommendations for protocol, server, client, and market developers, including formal namespaces, improved resource sharing, transparent documentation, and client-side optimizations to ensure a more compatible and efficient AI agent ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Includes Adaptive Temperature Option for Automatic Thermostat Adjustment</h1>
    <h2>iOS 26 introduces a new Home app feature called Adaptive Temperature, designed to automatically adjust your thermostat based on whether you are home, away, or extended away. This feature utilizes Activity History and optionally device location or occupancy sensors to predict user arrival and optimize temperature settings. However, it's currently unclear if Adaptive Temperature is fully functional, as some users are reporting difficulty finding the setting or enabling it with their existing HomeKit thermostats.</h2>
