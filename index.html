    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities create privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and link a user's separate activities across different digital credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process, enabling users to selectively disclose information while preventing any part of the credential, beyond explicit choices, from linking their interactions, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Air is Launching Soon, Here Are All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is poised to be the most significant design overhaul since the iPhone X, boasting an ultra-thin 5.5mm profile that makes it the lightest iPhone to date. It will feature a 6.6-inch LTPO OLED display with improved brightness and potential 120Hz ProMotion, powered by an A19 or A19 Pro chip with 12GB RAM, alongside an upgraded 24-megapixel front camera. Despite its sleekness potentially leading to a smaller battery and a single 48-megapixel rear camera, it will offer Qi 2.2 wireless charging, Wi-Fi 7 support, and an estimated starting price of $899.</h2>
