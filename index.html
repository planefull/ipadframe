    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or failure. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and carefully managing context to prevent overflow. SentinelStep, implemented in the open-source Magentic-UI, significantly improves success rates for extended monitoring tasks, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>Sam Sung, an Apple employee, went viral in 2012 because his name closely resembled Apple's competitor, Samsung, leading to significant stress and fear for his job. Apple eventually removed him from the sales floor and took his business cards as the situation escalated, prompting him to leave the company in 2013. Years later, he changed his name to Struan to escape the "internet joke" reputation, though he now advises his younger self to view the incident more lightheartedly.</h2>
