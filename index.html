    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, despite their convenience, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers in credentials allow for tracking and profiling of user behavior across various digital interactions. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds unlinkability to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, employing a two-stage process, to allow users to prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, all without requiring issuing organizations to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing iOS 18.7 for iPhones as iOS 26 Release Date Nears</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7, expected in September, which will primarily address security vulnerabilities. This update marks one of the final ones for iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, as these devices will not support the forthcoming iOS 26. iOS 26, compatible with iPhone 11 and newer, is also nearing its public release, anticipated around mid-September.</h2>
