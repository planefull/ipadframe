    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while offering convenience, create privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers in credentials can track user activities across different applications and services. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent leverages zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to verify specific facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or connecting separate interactions, making it privacy-preserving and efficient for mobile devices without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Kuo: AirPods Pro 3 Coming Soon, But Bigger Upgrade Arriving Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release the AirPods Pro 3 in the second half of 2025, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, possibly at the iPhone 17 event. These new earbuds are rumored to feature heart rate monitoring, a smaller charging case, improved sound quality, and enhanced active noise cancellation. A more significant hardware upgrade for the AirPods Pro, potentially including infrared cameras for advanced spatial audio and gesture control, is anticipated for 2026.</h2>
