    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, detailed in a Microsoft Research podcast, revealed a "zero-day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team rapidly responded by developing and implementing "patches" to screening software, significantly strengthening defenses against these AI-generated threats. This project not only improved global biosecurity but also established a novel model for responsible disclosure and collaboration in addressing dual-use AI risks in biotechnology.</h2>

    <h1>When Will Apple's Macs Get M5 Chips? 2025-2026 Launch Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next-generation M5 silicon chip is expected to debut in some new products by the end of 2025, though most Mac refreshes are anticipated in 2026. Specific updates include the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac mini, with timings ranging from late 2025 for a 14-inch MacBook Pro to early 2026 for most others. More powerful M5 Max and Ultra chips for the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are not expected until late 2026.</h2>
