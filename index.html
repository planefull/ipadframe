    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in connected LED lighting, struggled to provide accurate and efficient technical answers to professional users due to its extensive and complex product documentation, which traditional RAG systems couldn't fully process. To overcome this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, leveraging original documents for an end-to-end knowledge loop, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities for industrial knowledge management.</h2>
