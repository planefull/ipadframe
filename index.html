    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to address the limitations of current AI models in analyzing long-form video and large image collections, which often struggle with temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent utilizes a Planner–Critic architecture that enables strategic planning, tool-based reasoning, and self-evaluation through iterative feedback loops. This system significantly enhances performance on complex visual question-answering tasks by integrating modality-specific agents and provides explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal reasoning.</h2>

    <h1>12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple's 2026 Budget Tablet</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning to update its most affordable tablet with the 12th-generation iPad, expected to launch in spring 2026. This new model is anticipated to receive significant internal upgrades, including an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence support and improved performance, plus an N1 chip offering Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. While pricing is expected to remain around $349, there are no major design changes rumored, so it will likely retain the look of the 10th-generation iPad.</h2>
