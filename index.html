    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data, struggling with information overload and inefficient reanalysis processes, which leads to low initial diagnosis rates and prolonged patient suffering. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively designed a generative AI assistant to streamline the complex "sensemaking" tasks involved in genetic analysis. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific evidence and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, fostering human-AI collaboration for better patient outcomes.</h2>
