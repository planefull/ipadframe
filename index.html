    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis for rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute studied how a generative AI assistant could enhance their sensemaking tasks. The proposed AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating crucial gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>EU Has 'No Intention' to Repeal DMA Following Apple Challenge</h1>
    <h2>The European Commission has firmly rejected Apple's requests to repeal the Digital Markets Act (DMA), stating it has "absolutely no intention" of getting rid of the EU law designed to regulate big tech. Apple contends that the DMA negatively impacts European iPhone users by increasing risks of malware and fraud, invading privacy, and forcing delays in key features, urging an independent evaluation of the law's effects. However, the EC dismissed Apple's claims, affirming that the DMA does not require lowering privacy or security standards, while Apple has already faced fines and challenged other aspects of the legislation.</h2>
