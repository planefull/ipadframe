    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check without exhausting their context window or giving up. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to complete these tasks through dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring durations, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>
