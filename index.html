    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>Existing safety benchmarks struggle to effectively evaluate the real-world security risks of AI code agents, especially concerning dynamic execution and combined attack methods. To address this, researchers introduced RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed for LLM-based code agents. RedCodeAgent uses an adaptive memory module, a specialized toolbox with code substitution, and simulated execution environments to learn, adapt, and consistently uncover vulnerabilities across diverse programming languages and code agents, outperforming traditional red-teaming methods.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.2 to Allow Third-Party App Stores in Japan Ahead of Regulatory Deadline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new iOS 26.2 beta reveals that iPhone users in Japan will soon gain the ability to install alternative app marketplaces, such as AltStore PAL and Epic Games. This expansion, previously exclusive to the EU, is in compliance with new Japanese laws passed in 2024 and guidelines established in August 2025, which aim to foster competition by requiring third-party app store and payment system access. Both the public release of iOS 26.2 and the enforcement of Japan's new Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines are expected in December 2025.</h2>
