    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but present significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and profiled. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prevent linking between their digital interactions, all without requiring credential-issuing organizations to update their existing infrastructure.</h2>
