    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing. The research identified challenges such as information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. They designed an AI assistant prototype to address these by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>
