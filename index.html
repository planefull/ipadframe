    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has introduced RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that entirely replaces traditional 3D rendering pipelines with machine learning, eliminating the need for physics-based techniques like ray tracing or rasterization. This model is the first to learn a complete graphics rendering process, supporting arbitrary 3D scenes and global illumination by using triangle and ray bundle tokens processed through a dual-branch transformer architecture. RenderFormer represents a significant step forward in neural rendering, demonstrating the potential for deep learning to reshape visual computing and integrate advanced graphics into future AI systems.</h2>

    <h1>New Apple Watch 5G Feature Missing in Multiple Countries at Launch</h1>
    <h2>The new Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3 models feature an upgraded 5G modem and antenna architecture. However, 5G connectivity will not be available in many countries at launch, including Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia, though it will be active in the US, UK, Germany, and others. This limitation is likely due to a lack of regulatory approval or carrier support, but the watches may have the necessary hardware for future activation.</h2>
