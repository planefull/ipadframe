    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate credential uses to track user behavior. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used digital identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses, without requiring issuers to update their systems. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, which enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or allowing their interactions to be linked.</h2>

    <h1>One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming standard iPhone 17, positioned as Apple's most affordable new model, is expected to feature a larger 6.3-inch display and could bring 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates for the first time. It will be powered by an A19 chip with vapor chamber cooling, include a custom Wi-Fi 7 chip, and boast an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera. While its rear camera setup remains similar to the iPhone 16, the device is slated for introduction on September 9th, possibly offering new green and purple color options.</h2>
