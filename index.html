    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Research, uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a significant dual-use risk. A cross-sector team then developed and deployed more robust screening "patches," akin to cybersecurity responses, which were shared globally to strengthen nucleic acid synthesis biosecurity. This pioneering effort also established a new "perpetual gatekeeping" model for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific data, emphasizing the continuous need for vigilance and adaptive policies to manage evolving AI risks.</h2>
