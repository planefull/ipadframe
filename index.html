    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses "tool-space interference" as a new challenge arising from the increasing adoption of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), where diverse AI agents and tools must cooperate. While vertical integration has been effective, the burgeoning "society of agents" leveraging vast, uncoordinated tool catalogs through MCP leads to issues like excessive tool counts, overly long responses, complex parameters, and naming conflicts, hindering overall performance. To address this, the authors recommend that protocol developers implement formal namespaces and better resource sharing, server developers provide transparent documentation, and client and market developers focus on optimizations and standardization to ensure scalable and interoperable agent ecosystems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's New Dynamic 40W to 60W Charger Has a Key Advantage</h1>
    <h2>ChargerLAB's teardown of Apple's new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max reveals its key advantage: it's roughly the same compact size as the 20W charger, despite offering significantly higher wattage. This is achieved through support for USB-C Power Delivery 3.2 with SPR AVS, though the 60W limit is typically for short bursts due to thermal constraints. Costing $39, the adapter can rapidly charge devices like the upcoming iPhone 17 models up to 50% in 20 minutes, serving as a spiritual successor to Apple's discontinued 30W adapter.</h2>
