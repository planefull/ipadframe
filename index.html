    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be tracked back to an individual, even with features like selective disclosure. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by employing efficient zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to verify specific facts about their credentials without revealing linking data or requiring issuing organizations to update their systems.</h2>
