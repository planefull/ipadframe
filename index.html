    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The study identified key challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis, including information overload, collaborative sharing inefficiencies, and difficulties in prioritizing case reanalysis. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to address these issues by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to enhance diagnostic efficiency and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>Review: A Week With the iPhone 17 Pro</h1>
    <h2>After a week with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, the devices demonstrate impressive durability, with the Ceramic Shield 2 display resisting scratches from everyday pocket items. Key improvements include a highly effective vapor chamber cooling system that prevents overheating and substantial gains in battery life, especially for the Pro Max. Additionally, the front camera offers major quality improvements, and the new 8x optical zoom telephoto lens performs well in good lighting, making these models a potentially worthwhile upgrade.</h2>
