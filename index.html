    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models face challenges analyzing long-form video and large-scale image data, as they typically offer single-pass inference and struggle with complex temporal or cross-modal reasoning. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system with a Planner–Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning. This agent uses specialized tools for both video and image analysis, enhancing base model performance and providing explainable, extensible, and scalable solutions for complex visual queries.</h2>
