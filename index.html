    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the rise of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables horizontal integration of diverse tools, moving beyond vertically integrated systems. This shift, while expanding capabilities, introduces "tool-space interference" due to challenges like an overwhelming number of tools, lengthy responses, complex parameters, naming conflicts, and inadequate error handling, which collectively hinder agent effectiveness. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends protocol enhancements (e.g., formal namespaces, client-provided resources), server developers offering transparent documentation, client developers implementing optimizations, and marketplace developers standardizing practices for a more interoperable and efficient agent ecosystem.</h2>
