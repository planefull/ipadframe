    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare genetic diseases. Genetic professionals currently face significant challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis of complex whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates. The research proposes an AI-enhanced assistant designed to synthesize biomedical data, flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregate information about genes and variants from literature, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>

    <h1>Five Years After Apple Broke Up With Intel, Intel is Begging for Money</h1>
    <h2>Intel has initiated discussions with Apple about a potential investment and closer collaboration, though talks are in early stages. This outreach comes as Intel faces significant financial difficulties, marked by job cuts and canceled factory plans, despite recent investments from the U.S. government, Nvidia, and SoftBank. While Apple has moved away from Intel chips, a future partnership could potentially involve Intel manufacturing some components for Apple, rather than Apple reverting to Intel-designed silicon.</h2>
