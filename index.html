    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated on a study to design a generative AI-based assistant to support these professionals in complex data sensemaking. The proposed AI assistant aims to streamline diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>
