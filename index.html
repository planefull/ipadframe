    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, like watching for email replies or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check. To solve this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype that enables agents to efficiently handle such tasks. SentinelStep employs dynamic polling intervals and careful context management, significantly improving agents' reliability for monitoring over extended durations and paving the way for more proactive AI assistants.</h2>
