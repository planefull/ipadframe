    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected lighting, faced challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers from its vast, complex, and multimodal product documentation to professional users. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by leveraging PIKE-RAG's ability to parse multimodal documents, establish end-to-end knowledge loops, and perform dynamic multi-hop reasoning.</h2>
