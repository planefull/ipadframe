    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast "Ideas" features the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI tools for protein design could be misused to create toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers demonstrated this "zero day" vulnerability by generating AI-rewritten toxic proteins, then collaborated across sectors to develop and implement more robust screening solutions, akin to cybersecurity patches. This effort not only strengthened global biosecurity protocols for nucleic acid synthesis but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly sharing sensitive dual-use research data and software.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Hits Back at EU Law in Court</h1>
    <h2>Apple has launched a broad legal challenge against the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU's General Court, arguing the new competition regime unlawfully compels changes to the iPhone, App Store, and iMessage. The company claims the DMA's obligations are incompatible with protections of security, privacy, and property rights under EU law, placing "hugely onerous and intrusive burdens" on designated gatekeepers. Apple specifically contests requirements for iPhone interoperability, the App Store's inclusion as a covered service, and the procedural propriety of an inquiry into iMessage's designation.</h2>
