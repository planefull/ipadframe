    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for price drops or email responses because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient always-on AI assistants.</h2>
