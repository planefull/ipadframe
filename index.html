    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research Podcast episode "Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project" explores the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, highlighting a vulnerability where AI-generated toxic protein variants (like ricin) could bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, described as the first "zero day" in AI and biosecurity. Through a cross-sector collaboration, the project developed and implemented AI-resilient screening solutions, shared globally to strengthen biosecurity. Additionally, the team pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing sensitive research data, balancing open science with the critical need to mitigate information hazards in dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Launch of Apple's First Foldable iPhone Could Be Delayed</h1>
    <h2>According to Mizuho Securities, Apple's first foldable iPhone launch could be delayed until 2027, possibly due to Apple taking longer to finalize key design elements such as the hinge, which has already led to reduced display panel production forecasts. A 2026 launch is still possible, but with potential production shortages. The report also notes potential delays for the iPhone 18 lineup and mentions development of a second foldable iPhone and an 18.9-inch foldable MacBook for later release.</h2>
