    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Large Language Model (LLM) agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to reliably monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent success rates for tasks lasting hours, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Three More Apple Apps Just Got Liquid Glass Updates</h1>
    <h2>Apple has updated GarageBand, Photomator, and Pixelmator Pro with new Liquid Glass-compatible icons for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe. GarageBand now features a realistic-looking guitar icon, while Photomator and Pixelmator Pro for Mac shed their unappealing border designs to meet macOS Tahoe's updated icon requirements. This update follows Apple's recent acquisition of the Pixelmator apps and precedes planned Liquid Glass icon updates for other Apple apps like iMovie and Keynote.</h2>
