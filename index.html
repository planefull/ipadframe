    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems in DNA synthesis. A cross-sector team swiftly developed and deployed more robust, AI-resilient screening solutions, subsequently sharing these "patches" globally to strengthen defenses against misuse. This effort established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for responsibly disclosing dual-use research, highlighting the ongoing need for proactive collaboration and adaptable safeguards as AI capabilities advance.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to release a base MacBook Pro model equipped with the standard M5 chip soon, before its higher-end counterparts. 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are then anticipated to debut in early 2026. This staggered launch is supported by previous release patterns, recent FCC documents, and an M5 chip performance leak, which suggests a return to decoupled MacBook Pro updates.</h2>
