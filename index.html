    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study exploring how generative AI can assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare genetic diseases. The research identified key challenges like information overload, inefficient collaborative sharing, and difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases in whole genome sequencing. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype to address these by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data from scientific literature, aiming to streamline the diagnostic process and improve patient outcomes.</h2>
