    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to wasted resources or missed events. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism implemented in their Magentic-UI agentic system that enables agents to complete long-running monitoring tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context effectively. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks spanning hours or days, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and efficient always-on AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>If You Thought Ads in Apple Maps Was Bad, Samsung is Putting Ads on $1,900+ Refrigerators</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is rolling out a software update to its "Family Hub" smart refrigerators, which will display advertisements on their integrated screens starting this month. These ads, initially for Samsung products, will appear on refrigerators costing up to $3,499 and are enabled by default, surprising many existing customers. While users can opt out through settings, doing so disables all widget features, and Samsung reportedly plans to eventually include third-party advertisers.</h2>
