    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, featured in the Microsoft Research podcast, uncovered a significant biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing screening systems, essentially creating a "zero-day" threat for potential misuse. In response, a collaborative team developed AI biosecurity "red-teaming" approaches, leading to a more robust protein screening system, similar to cybersecurity patches, which has been shared globally. This project also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing sensitive dual-use scientific data, aiming to balance open science with minimizing the risk of malevolent applications.</h2>

    <h1>5+ New Features Your iPhone Will Get in iOS 26.1</h1>
    <h2>Apple is currently beta testing iOS 26.1, the first major update to iOS 26, which brings numerous new features and interface changes, but not the long-awaited new Siri. Key updates include a slide-to-stop for alarms, custom workout creation in the Fitness app, and expanded language support for Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation. Additionally, the update features UI refinements like left-aligned text in Settings and Home Screen folders, new Liquid Glass effects, and the reintroduction of Slide Over multitasking for iPadOS.</h2>
