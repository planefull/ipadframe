    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The rise of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has led to a "society of tools," transitioning from vertically integrated systems to horizontally integrated ones where diverse agents and tools must cooperate. However, this horizontal integration introduces "tool-space interference," manifesting as challenges like excessively large tool catalogs, long response lengths, complex parameter schemas, tool name collisions, and inadequate error messages, which collectively degrade agent performance and task completion. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, improving resource sharing protocols, encouraging transparent server documentation, and developing client-side optimizations to foster a more compatible and scalable AI ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Delays iPhone Air Launch in China Over eSIM Approval Issues</h1>
    <h2>Apple has postponed the release of its new iPhone Air in China due to unresolved regulatory issues concerning the device's eSIM-only requirement. The iPhone Air's exclusive reliance on eSIM is problematic because Chinese carriers have not traditionally supported this technology for iPhones, leading Apple to remove specific launch dates from its Chinese website. To address the challenge, Apple is now working with all three state-owned Chinese carriers to secure regulatory approval for eSIM support, while other iPhone 17 models are proceeding with their original launch schedules.</h2>
