    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, demonstrating that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. This discovery, deemed a "zero-day" vulnerability, prompted a cybersecurity-style response, leading to the development of more robust protein screening mechanisms. The project successfully strengthened global biosecurity against AI-enabled threats and established a novel, perpetually gatekept peer-review process for responsibly sharing sensitive research.</h2>
