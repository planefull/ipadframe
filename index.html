    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and a cross-sector team, investigated the "dual-use" potential of AI in protein design, demonstrating that AI could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. This discovery was treated as a "zero-day" vulnerability, prompting a cybersecurity-style response to develop and implement more robust screening methods. The project successfully fortified biosecurity defenses against AI-designed threats and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible sharing of sensitive research data to mitigate information hazards.</h2>

    <h1>OpenAI Strengthens Sora Protections Following Celebrity Deepfake Concerns</h1>
    <h2>OpenAI's Sora AI video app will no longer permit users to create content featuring celebrity likenesses or voices without explicit consent. This decision follows complaints from figures like actor Bryan Cranston and the estates of Robin Williams and Martin Luther King Jr., who expressed concerns about unauthorized deepfakes. Consequently, OpenAI has strengthened its guardrails to ensure individuals' rights to determine how their likeness is used and is collaborating with industry groups on protection policies.</h2>
