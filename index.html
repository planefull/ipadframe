    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, New York, is set to reopen on Friday, November 21, following extensive renovations that will introduce a modern design with more wood paneling. The store, originally opened in 2002 at Long Island's largest shopping mall, has been closed for approximately a year, with a temporary location serving customers during the revamp. This renovation is part of a larger strategy by Apple, as the company is also updating multiple other U.S. stores, recently opened a relocated store in Texas, and completed renovations at an Australian location.</h2>
