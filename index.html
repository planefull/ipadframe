    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research "Paraphrase Project" exposed a critical vulnerability: AI tools could be used to redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, in ways that evaded existing biosecurity screening systems, essentially creating a "zero-day" threat. A cross-sector team developed and deployed "patches" to strengthen these screening tools, demonstrating that AI-resilient solutions are possible and need continuous updates. This effort also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible data sharing, offering a model for navigating information hazards in dual-use technologies like AI and synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Remains the World's Most Valuable Brand in 2025</h1>
    <h2>Apple has retained its position as the world's most valuable brand for the 13th consecutive year, topping Interbrand's 2025 ranking with an estimated brand value of $470.9 billion, despite a 4% decline. The annual Interbrand report evaluates companies on financial performance and brand strength, noting a 4.4% year-over-year increase in the combined value of the top 100 brands. While Microsoft secured second place, the report also highlighted AI chipmaker Nvidia's record 116% surge in brand value, moving from 36th to 15th, alongside declines for Nike and Tesla.</h2>
