    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on leveraging generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The research identified key challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis, such as information overload, difficulties in collaborative sharing, and prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype aimed at flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately striving to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>
