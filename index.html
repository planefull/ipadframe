    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to complex technical inquiries due to vast, diverse product documentation. To overcome this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This advanced RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% by handling multimodal documents, ensuring reliable data sources, and employing multi-hop reasoning for complex questions.</h2>
