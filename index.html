    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare diseases. The study identified challenges like information overload and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases in whole genome sequencing analysis. They designed an AI assistant prototype to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app, allowing them to use a digital ID on their iPhone or Apple Watch. This feature enables use at select U.S. airports for TSA verification and for age verification in retail, apps, and online. However, a $5 fee is required, and users should still carry their physical ID as the digital version is not universally accepted.</h2>
