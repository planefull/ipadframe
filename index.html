    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed red-teaming approaches and implemented "patches" that significantly strengthened these screening systems against AI-generated variants. This collaborative effort not only enhanced global biosecurity and demonstrated a cybersecurity-style response to dual-use AI risks but also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for responsible sharing of sensitive scientific information.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Said to Cut iPhone Air Production Amid Underwhelming Sales</h1>
    <h2>Apple reportedly plans to cut production of the iPhone Air by one million units due to underwhelming sales performance, especially in Western markets. In contrast, the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max models are all seeing strong sales, leading Apple to increase their production by two million units. This adjustment results in an overall increased production forecast for the iPhone 17 series, despite the iPhone Air being an outlier.</h2>
