    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context, cross-modal grounding, and iterative processing. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an open-source framework built on AutoGen featuring a Planner–Critic architecture. This design enables iterative, tool-based reasoning and self-evaluation across modalities, significantly enhancing AI's ability to analyze and understand complex visual data, as demonstrated by improved performance on various benchmarks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Mac Plans</h1>
    <h2>Apple has extensive Mac updates planned for 2026, bringing M5 chips to most models across the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and Mac Studio lines. The year will also see the introduction of a new low-cost MacBook with an A18 Pro chip, refreshed Mac displays, and a potential M5 Ultra for the Mac Studio. Notably, a revamped OLED MacBook Pro featuring a touchscreen and next-generation M6 chip is also a possibility toward the end of 2026.</h2>
