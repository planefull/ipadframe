    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, revealed that AI-powered protein design tools could rewrite toxic protein sequences to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a significant "zero-day" vulnerability. A collaborative cross-sector team then developed a "red-teaming" approach to identify these evasive variants, leading to the creation and implementation of more robust screening patches by DNA synthesis companies worldwide. Beyond the technical fix, the project established a new model for managing information hazards in dual-use research, featuring a cybersecurity-style emergency response and a perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive scientific data and software.</h2>

    <h1>When Will Apple's Macs Get M5 Chips? 2025-2026 Launch Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next-generation M5 silicon chip is expected to debut in some new products by late 2025, with the 14-inch MacBook Pro potentially being the first Mac to receive it. Most other Mac refreshes, including the MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac mini, are projected for early 2026. High-end machines like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, requiring M5 Max or Ultra chips, are anticipated much later, likely in late 2026.</h2>
