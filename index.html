    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to delayed diagnoses for rare diseases due to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a prototype generative AI assistant. This AI aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating relevant literature, thereby improving diagnostic yield and shortening the time to diagnosis for rare genetic conditions.</h2>
