    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Research, explored the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, discovering that generative AI tools could reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, akin to a "zero day" vulnerability. In response, a cross-sector team developed an AI biosecurity "red-teaming" pipeline, successfully identifying these vulnerabilities and implementing "patches" that strengthened protein screening tools used by major DNA synthesis companies worldwide. This effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for managing sensitive research data, setting a precedent for responsible disclosure and ongoing defense against AI-accelerated biological risks.</h2>
