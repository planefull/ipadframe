    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, grappling with information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and prioritizing reanalysis, which leads to low diagnosis rates and extended patient waits. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant based on empirical research and expert input. This AI-powered tool is intended to streamline the diagnostic process by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of genetic information, thereby improving diagnostic yield and shortening the time to diagnosis for rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Proton Mail iOS App Gets Major Redesign With Offline Mode</h1>
    <h2>Proton Mail has rolled out a major update for its iOS and Android apps, introducing a completely rebuilt interface and a new offline mode that allows users to read, write, and organize emails without an internet connection. The update also features a relocated compose button for easier access and significantly improved performance for common tasks like scrolling, archiving, and replying. Additionally, both platforms now share a common codebase for faster future updates, and Android users gain access to previously iOS-exclusive email snoozing and scheduling features.</h2>
