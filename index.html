    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to complex technical inquiries due to vast, multimodal product documentation and limitations of traditional RAG systems. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology within their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration, leveraging PIKE-RAG's ability to parse multimodal content, adapt to domain-specific reasoning, and perform multi-hop reasoning for complex questions, resulted in a significant 12% improvement in answer accuracy.</h2>

    <h1>Happy 24th Anniversary, iPod</h1>
    <h2>The first-generation iPod launched on November 10, 2001, following a period of varied speculation and leaks, where some rumors inaccurately described it as a PDA or home stereo component. Despite initial criticisms about its high price and Mac-only compatibility, the iPod proved revolutionary for its storage capacity and design, quickly becoming a popular device that paved the way for the iPhone. The iPod line was officially discontinued in 2022, as its functionality became integrated into other Apple products, though its "spirit" is said to live on in devices like the iPhone and HomePod.</h2>
