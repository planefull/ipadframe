    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in connected LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to complex technical questions from professional users, due to a vast array of product models and fragmented documentation. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Microsoft Azure. This integration resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by effectively parsing multimodal documents, eliminating reliance on erroneous data sources, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: AirPods Pro 3 and What's Coming Next</h1>
    <h2>The latest episode of The MacRumors Show reviews the recently launched AirPods Pro 3, highlighting its refined design, improved active noise cancellation, and heart rate monitoring after two months of use. However, some users report static and high-pitched whine issues, which Apple is investigating, while a more premium AirPods Pro 3 with gesture controls and Vision Pro integration is anticipated next year. Looking further ahead, Apple is also working on a new H3 chip for AirPods 5 and a lighter AirPods Max 2, expected by 2027 with updated features.</h2>
