    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" by Microsoft Research and collaborators uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed a red-teaming pipeline to identify these AI-enabled threats and created technical "patches" to strengthen global biosecurity screening, which have now been shared with the industry. The project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible data and software sharing in scientific publications, balancing open science with the need to minimize information hazards for dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>WhatsApp Testing Message Limits to Combat Spam</h1>
    <h2>WhatsApp is reportedly testing new message limits for individual users and businesses to combat spam on its popular platform. This feature restricts the number of messages that can be sent to unknown contacts without a response, with all messages counting towards a monthly cap until a reply is received. Designed to target spammers rather than average users, the new controls aim to significantly reduce unwanted messages, a long-standing issue for the app.</h2>
