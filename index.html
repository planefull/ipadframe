    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The rise of agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is fostering a "society of agents and tools," moving beyond vertically integrated systems towards broad horizontal integration. However, this introduces "tool-space interference," manifesting as reduced effectiveness due to issues like large tool catalogs, excessive response lengths, complex parameter schemas, naming conflicts, and poor error handling. To mitigate these challenges and ensure future compatibility, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, enhancing protocol support for client-provided resources, improving server documentation, and having clients and marketplaces provide adaptive optimizations.</h2>
