    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data synthesis, when diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing, leading to low diagnosis rates. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore how generative AI can support these professionals. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype designed to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant information, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce the time to diagnosis for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
