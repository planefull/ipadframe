    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research *Ideas* podcast episode discusses the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, specifically its potential to create toxic proteins that could evade existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers discovered that AI tools could "paraphrase" known toxic protein sequences, making them undetectable by current defenses, representing a "zero-day" vulnerability in biosecurity. In response, a cross-sector team developed and implemented "patches" for these screening systems, fostering a more AI-resilient defense and pioneering a new perpetual gatekeeping approach for sensitive research data to balance open science with minimizing misuse risks.</h2>
