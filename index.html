    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, enabling them to evade current biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative cross-sector team utilized AI-enabled "red-teaming" to demonstrate this risk and subsequently developed more robust protein screening solutions and "patches" for global implementation. This effort also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive scientific data, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance, proactive defense, and responsible information sharing in managing AI's dual-use potential in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store in Greater San Diego Area to Receive All-New Design</h1>
    <h2>Apple's retail store at The Forum in Carlsbad, California, is slated for a major renovation to feature an all-new modern design, including a likely addition of a dedicated Apple Pickup station. The original store will close temporarily for these renovations starting Wednesday, October 15, with the project expected to take many months to complete. During the remodeling, a temporary Apple store will open in the same plaza on Saturday, October 18, located just a short distance from the original site.</h2>
