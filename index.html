    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, create privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track users across multiple credential uses, like mobile driver's licenses or app logins. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats without requiring issuers to update their systems. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Slashes 2025 MLS Season Pass to as Low as $25</h1>
    <h2>Apple has drastically cut the price of the MLS Season Pass for the remainder of the 2025 season, now offering it for $29, or $25 for Apple TV+ subscribers, a significant drop from its original $99 annual cost. This reduced price includes access to all live and on-demand matches, playoffs, "MLS 360," and "Sunday Night Soccer." The discounted annual subscription automatically renews at the full $99 price for 2026 unless manually canceled, consistent with Apple's strategy of lowering costs later in the season.</h2>
