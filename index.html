    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research issued a clarification regarding their recent paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," to address misunderstandings about its conclusions. The original study found that AI chatbots are most useful for assisting with knowledge work and communication tasks, such such as writing and information gathering, by performing specific subtasks within various occupations. The authors explicitly state that their research does not conclude that AI will eliminate jobs, cautioning against over-interpreting findings that do not account for the full spectrum of skills and context required in real-world professions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Similar to the iPhone 4 bumper, this accessory would cover the device's edges to provide protection without adding significant bulk. Additionally, Apple is also rumored to be planning an iPhone 17 Air battery case, with both accessories expected to be unveiled in September.</h2>
