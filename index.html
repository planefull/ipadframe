    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow, significantly improving agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Loses UK Antitrust Lawsuit Over App Store Fees, Faces £1.5 Billion in Damages</h1>
    <h2>The UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) has ruled that Apple engaged in anticompetitive behavior by charging "excessive and unfair prices" to App Store developers between October 2015 and the end of 2020. The Tribunal found Apple abused its monopoly over iOS app distribution and in-app payments, forcing developers into a system with commissions up to 30 percent, which resulted in higher prices for consumers. Consequently, Apple faces a class action lawsuit seeking up to £1.5 billion in damages for UK consumers, though the company intends to appeal the decision.</h2>
