    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data interpretation, when diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed a generative AI assistant to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data and flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings. This AI-enhanced approach aims to boost diagnostic yield, reduce diagnosis time, and ultimately improve the quality of life for patients with rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, meaning users who upgraded to the recently released iOS 26 can no longer downgrade to the older version. This practice prevents the installation of outdated, less secure software by disabling server-side verification checks. While users are not forced to update to iOS 26, once a device is upgraded, there is no option to revert, a policy also extended to iPadOS and tvOS.</h2>
