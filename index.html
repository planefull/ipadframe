    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, which require temporal understanding, cross-modal grounding, and iterative analysis beyond single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner-Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative reasoning for both images and videos. This agent framework utilizes modality-specific tools and a reflective Critic loop to analyze complex queries, delivering more accurate, explainable, and scalable insights compared to conventional models.</h2>

    <h1>Another Designer Leaves Apple</h1>
    <h2>Abidur Chowdhury, the Apple designer who introduced the iPhone Air and was considered a rising star, has left the company to join an AI startup, reportedly causing internal ripples. His departure continues a trend of designers leaving Apple's industrial design team since Jony Ive's exit in 2019, though Chowdhury's move was unrelated to the iPhone Air's disappointing sales. This shift also comes as former operations chief Jeff Williams, who oversaw product design, recently retired, meaning Apple's design team now reports directly to CEO Tim Cook.</h2>
