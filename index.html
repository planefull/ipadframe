    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project revealed a significant biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to evade existing screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team rapidly developed and deployed "patches" that enhanced these screening systems, making them more resilient against AI-generated variants. This pioneering work also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for managing sensitive scientific information, underscoring the ongoing need for proactive, collaborative defenses against the dual-use challenges of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Samsung to Unveil Apple Vision Pro Competitor Tomorrow</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is holding a Galaxy Event tomorrow to unveil its "Project Moohan" mixed reality headset, positioned as a direct competitor to the Apple Vision Pro. This "AI-native device" will run on Android XR, an operating system co-developed with Google and Qualcomm, offering more AI features like Gemini and enhanced Google services. Designed to be lightweight and ergonomically optimized, the headset features a ski-goggle-like display, fabric seal, and an external battery, similar to its rival.</h2>
