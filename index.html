    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This innovation allows agents to monitor conditions for hours or days without wasting resources or giving up, significantly improving reliability for such tasks.</h2>
