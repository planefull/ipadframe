    <h1>BlueCodeAgent: A blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming for CodeGen AI</h1>
    <h2>Large language models (LLMs) used for code generation pose significant security risks, producing potentially malicious, biased, or vulnerable code, while current defensive strategies (blue teaming) face limitations like poor conceptual alignment, over-conservatism, and incomplete risk coverage. To address this, researchers developed BlueCodeAgent, a framework that leverages automated red teaming to generate diverse risky code examples and distills this knowledge into actionable "constitutions" or safety rules. This knowledge-enhanced blue teaming, combined with dynamic sandbox-based testing, significantly improves the detection of unsafe instructions and vulnerable code, reducing false positives and achieving an average 12.7% F1 score improvement across various tasks by enhancing context-aware risk detection.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Intelligence Apparently Too Smart for M1 Macs After Listing Error</h1>
    <h2>Apple's U.S. website for Apple Intelligence has created confusion by updating its Mac compatibility requirements to "M2 or later," seemingly dropping support for M1 Macs. However, regional Apple websites (UK, Canada) and Apple's support pages still list M1 Macs as compatible with the new AI features. This discrepancy is believed to be an accidental editing error during a recent webpage update, and Apple is expected to correct the U.S. page shortly.</h2>
