    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and profile users across different credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information without revealing identifying data or linking separate interactions, and importantly, it works without requiring issuing organizations to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing iOS 18.7 for iPhones as iOS 26 Release Date Nears</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7 in September, an update expected to focus on security fixes for compatible iPhone models. This update will be one of the final releases for older devices such as the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, as they will not support the next major operating system. iOS 26, which is compatible with iPhone 11 and newer, is also anticipated for a public release around mid-September after months of beta testing.</h2>
