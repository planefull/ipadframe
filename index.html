    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with long-form visual data and large image/video libraries, requiring more than single-pass inference for complex real-world reasoning. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured reasoning. This agent uses iterative, tool-based reasoning with dedicated ImageAgent and VideoAgent components, significantly enhancing accuracy, explainability, and scalability for tasks involving long videos and extensive image collections.</h2>

    <h1>Will Apple Kill Google's Surprise Android to iPhone AirDrop Interoperability?</h1>
    <h2>Google surprisingly announced that its Quick Share feature on Pixel 10 phones now enables direct file sharing with Apple's AirDrop, creating a first-party interoperability between Android and iOS devices. This functionality was developed entirely by Google without Apple's collaboration or prior involvement, and was announced publicly as a surprise. While Apple has historically blocked similar third-party workarounds, Google's size and current regulatory pressures might make it difficult for Apple to shut down this new cross-platform file sharing solution.</h2>
