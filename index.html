    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is driving horizontal integration among diverse AI tools, expanding agent capabilities beyond vertically integrated systems into a "society of agents." However, this broad integration introduces "tool-space interference," causing issues like tool overload, excessive response lengths, complex parameters, naming conflicts, and poor error handling, which reduce overall effectiveness. To address these challenges, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, improving server documentation, enabling client-side optimizations, and fostering market-level compatibility solutions for a more robust and efficient AI agent ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>Here Are 5 Smaller iPhone Air Details You Might Have Missed, Including Only a Single Speaker</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone Air, launching Friday, comes with several notable differences compared to its Pro counterparts. It features only a single speaker, slower USB 2 data transfer speeds, and a less powerful 5-core GPU in its A19 Pro chip. Furthermore, the iPhone Air has slower wired and MagSafe wireless charging, and its Dynamic Island is positioned slightly lower due to its thin design.</h2>
