    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the significant challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing data. They designed a generative AI-based assistant to streamline complex analysis tasks, aiming to overcome issues like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis. This AI tool is envisioned to boost diagnostic accuracy, shorten diagnosis times by flagging relevant cases for reanalysis, and synthesize crucial genetic information, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app on their iPhone and Apple Watch. This digital ID can be used at select U.S. airports and for age verification, though residents will need to pay a $5 fee to obtain it. While convenient, the mobile ID is not universally accepted, so a physical license should still be carried, with North Dakota joining several other states in adopting this feature.</h2>
