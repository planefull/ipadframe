    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis, and inefficient data sharing. To address these issues, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool is designed to help genetic professionals by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing complex gene and variant data, ultimately aiming to increase diagnostic rates and reduce the time to diagnosis for rare genetic conditions.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 16 Pro Max 80% Charge Limit: One Year Later, Was It Worth It?</h1>
    <h2>The article details a one-year experiment where the author limited an iPhone 16 Pro Max's charge to 80% to evaluate its impact on battery longevity, a follow-up to a similar test on an iPhone 15. After one year and 299 charge cycles, the iPhone 16 Pro Max's battery capacity was 94%, identical to the previous year's results and only slightly less than a coworker's phone without a charge limit. The author concludes that the 80% charge limit was not worth the inconvenience for a one-year period, finding the results disappointing and suggesting a 90% or 95% limit might be more beneficial.</h2>
