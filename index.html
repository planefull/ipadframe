    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical biosecurity vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to bypass existing screening systems of DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, IBBIS, and Twist Bioscience, collaborated to "red-team" these AI-enabled threats and develop robust "patches" for screening software, strengthening global biosecurity. This effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible scientific disclosure, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to managing dual-use risks in AI and synthetic biology.</h2>

    <h1>Apple TV+ Being Rebranded as Apple TV</h1>
    <h2>Apple has announced that its streaming service, Apple TV+, is being rebranded. The service will now be known simply as "Apple TV," a change subtly revealed within a press release about "F1: The Movie" and accompanied by a promise of a "vibrant new identity." This rebranding might cause confusion, as "Apple TV" already refers to both the company's set-top box hardware and the app that hosts various content.</h2>
