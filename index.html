    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track user behavior across various digital interactions. Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses, preventing such tracking. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge SNARKs with an efficient two-stage process, allowing users to selectively disclose information and ensure their separate credential presentations remain unlinked without requiring updates from the organizations that issue these credentials.</h2>
