    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently "wait" and dynamically determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for extended periods. Integrated into Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, enabling the creation of more practical, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Microsoft Edge 'Copilot Mode' Brings More AI to Your Browser Tabs</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft has launched new features for its "Copilot Mode" in Edge, which provides a chat interface for asking questions, searching, and analyzing content across multiple tabs. Two new preview features, "Copilot Actions" and "Journeys," are rolling out to U.S. users; Actions enables agentic tasks and voice commands, while Journeys organizes browsing history by topic and suggests next steps. These additions aim to enhance the AI browser experience, allowing Copilot Mode to access browsing history with user permission, placing Edge in a competitive race to integrate AI capabilities into web browsers.</h2>
