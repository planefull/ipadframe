    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over time. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype. This innovation significantly improves the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, enabling them to proactively monitor conditions without wasting resources and laying the groundwork for more patient and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
