    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such like tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into Magentic-UI that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves task reliability over extended periods by adjusting polling frequency and preventing context overflow, paving the way for more practical, proactive, and persistent AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Giving Vision Pro Another Chance</h1>
    <h2>The latest episode of The MacRumors Show revisits the Apple Vision Pro to assess its new M5 model. This updated headset boasts an M5 chip for enhanced performance, 10% more rendered pixels, a 120Hz refresh rate, improved battery life, and a new counterweighted headband for greater comfort. The episode discusses how significantly these hardware and visionOS 26 software improvements, including new widgets and hands-free scrolling, make the device better and if it's finally time to give Apple's spatial computing device another chance.</h2>
