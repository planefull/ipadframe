    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a new mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days through dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation, evaluated using the synthetic SentinelBench environment, significantly improves the reliability of agents on longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Warns App Tracking Transparency Could Be Disabled in Europe</h1>
    <h2>Apple warns it may be "forced" to disable its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature in the European Union due to intense lobbying and regulatory pressure. This privacy tool allows iPhone and iPad users to control whether apps track their activity for advertising, but it has faced backlash and fines from European regulators who claim it abuses Apple's market power and disadvantages third-party advertisers. Despite presenting solutions, Apple indicates that proposed regulatory changes could undermine this key privacy feature, which it aims to keep available for European users.</h2>
