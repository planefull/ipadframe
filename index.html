    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that completely replaces traditional 3D rendering techniques with machine learning. This model uses transformer networks to process 3D scene data as triangle tokens and camera viewing information as ray bundle tokens, learning to simulate complex lighting and material interactions, including global illumination, without relying on ray tracing or rasterization. RenderFormer represents a significant advancement towards a general-purpose neural rendering model, demonstrating deep learning's capability to replicate the entire rendering pipeline and opening new possibilities for visual computing and AI integration.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Air Features 3D-Printed Titanium USB-C Port With Three Benefits</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new iPhone Air features a 3D-printed titanium USB-C port, which is touted as thinner, stronger, and more environmentally friendly due to using 33% less material. Despite this manufacturing innovation, the port is limited to outdated USB 2 speeds for data transfer. This 3D printing technology is also applied to the titanium cases of the new Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Series 11, further reducing raw material usage.</h2>
