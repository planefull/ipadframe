    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, uncovered a critical "zero-day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team addressed this by developing a "red-teaming" pipeline to generate and test these AI-created variants, resulting in a more robust protein screening system and patches shared globally with synthesis companies. This collaborative effort established a model for proactively tackling dual-use AI risks, including a novel approach to responsible information sharing, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance in biosecurity as AI capabilities advance.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning a staggered release for its M5 MacBook Pro lineup, with a base model featuring the standard M5 chip expected to launch soon. This initial release will precede the higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which are anticipated to debut in early 2026 with more powerful M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. This strategy marks a return to a decoupled launch, supported by historical precedents and recent FCC filings, with the M5 chip promising significant performance improvements over the M4.</h2>
