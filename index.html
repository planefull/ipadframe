    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" revealed a critical vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could generate toxic proteins, like ricin, that successfully evaded existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed "patches" to these systems, significantly strengthening their ability to detect AI-designed threats, marking the first "zero day" cybersecurity-style response in AI biosecurity. This collaboration not only improved technical safeguards but also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping approach for sensitive research data, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance and coordinated efforts to manage the dual-use risks of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Some Los Angeles Lakers Games Will Get 3D Live Streams on Vision Pro</h1>
    <h2>Some Los Angeles Lakers games during the 2025-26 season will be live-streamed in the Apple Immersive format on the Apple Vision Pro, starting early next year. These 180-degree 8K recordings with Spatial Audio, captured by new Blackmagic Design cameras, will be accessible via the forthcoming Spectrum SportsNet app. Viewers will need a Spectrum internet or SportsNet+ subscription and visionOS 26 to watch, with full game replays and highlights also available on demand.</h2>
