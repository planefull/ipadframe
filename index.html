    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" identified a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences to bypass existing screening systems, dubbed the "first zero day" in AI biosecurity. Through a collaborative "red-teaming" effort, the project developed and deployed robust new screening methods (patches) and a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive information, which were shared globally. This initiative establishes a crucial model for proactively addressing the dual-use challenges of AI in biology, emphasizing ongoing vigilance, responsible disclosure, and a layered defense against evolving threats.</h2>
