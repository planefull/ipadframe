    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, despite their convenience, create significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing various uses of credentials to be tracked and linked to individuals. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively share information without revealing underlying data or allowing their separate digital interactions to be connected, all without requiring updates to existing credential issuance systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Hints at iPhone 17 Models Lacking SIM Card Slot in More Countries</h1>
    <h2>Apple is signaling its intention to expand eSIM-only iPhones to more countries, likely starting with the upcoming iPhone 17 series. This move is indicated by a mandatory training course for Apple Authorized Reseller employees in the EU regarding eSIM support, to be completed by September 5, just before the iPhone 17 is expected to be announced. While the US already features eSIM-only iPhones, the iPhone 17 Air and potentially other models are anticipated to globally lack a physical SIM tray, offering benefits like enhanced security and easier management of multiple carriers.</h2>
