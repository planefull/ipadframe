    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks, particularly "linkability," which allows separate uses of credentials to be tracked and profiled. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or allowing their distinct digital interactions to be connected.</h2>
