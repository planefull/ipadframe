    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently fail at long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they cannot intelligently manage *when* to check, leading to resource waste or premature termination. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days using dynamic polling and careful context management. Implemented within their Magentic-UI prototype and open-sourced on GitHub, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring tasks while efficiently managing resources.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Preparing to Make More AirPods in India</h1>
    <h2>Foxconn's Hyderabad facility in India is preparing to significantly boost its AirPods production, aiming to double monthly output and more than double its workforce. The plant will increase production from over 100,000 units to 200,000 units per month by overhauling assembly lines and installing equipment from Vietnam, while its workforce is expected to grow from 2,000 to 5,000 employees. This expansion is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its manufacturing supply chain and reduce reliance on a single country.</h2>
