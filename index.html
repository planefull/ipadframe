    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, failing to know *when* to check for updates like email responses or price drops, leading to wasted resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability on extended tasks, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and efficient always-on assistants.</h2>
