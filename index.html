    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked to build comprehensive user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using efficient zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to selectively disclose information and prevent their digital interactions from being linked, without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>Rivian Activates Apple Car Key Support in Second-Generation Vehicles</h1>
    <h2>Rivian is finally activating support for Apple Car Keys for its second-generation R1S and R1T vehicles, enabling iPhone and Apple Watch users to unlock their cars via the Wallet app. This feature, which was announced over a year ago, uses NFC and Ultra Wideband technology for seamless integration, including capabilities like key sharing and Express Mode. While Rivian still declines to support Apple CarPlay, this rollout joins Apple Music integration as adopted Apple features by the EV manufacturer.</h2>
