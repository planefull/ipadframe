    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow various credential uses to be associated and detailed user profiles to be built. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent enables users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or connecting separate digital interactions, doing so efficiently for mobile devices and without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 18 Rumor Becomes iPhone 19 Rumor Two Days Before iPhone 17</h1>
    <h2>Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo now expects Samsung to begin supplying 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors for iPhones starting in 2027, likely for iPhone 19 models. These sensors, which Apple confirmed Samsung would provide from its Texas facility, are three-layer stacked image sensors offering benefits like higher pixel density and improved low-light performance. This marks a notable shift as Sony has historically been the exclusive supplier of image sensors for iPhone cameras.</h2>
