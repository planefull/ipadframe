    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project" by Microsoft Research, led by Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, uncovered a critical vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to evade current biosecurity screening systems, posing a "zero day" threat. In response, a cross-sector team developed and deployed more robust, AI-resilient protein screening solutions, which were shared with gene synthesis companies worldwide via the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC). The project also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive research data and methods, demonstrating a responsible approach to handling information hazards in dual-use AI and biological research.</h2>

    <h1>Eddy Cue Explains Why Apple TV+ is Now Apple TV</h1>
    <h2>Apple's services chief Eddy Cue announced that the streaming service Apple TV+ is being renamed to Apple TV. Cue explained that this change reflects how many people already refer to the service and marks its established presence since launching in 2019. Despite potential confusion with the Apple TV app and the Apple TV 4K hardware, Cue believes it won't be an issue as the hardware has a distinct "4K" suffix and the app's name remains consistent.</h2>
