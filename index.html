    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is a novel, fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety and security of AI code agents, addressing the limitations of existing static safety benchmarks. It leverages adaptive memory, specialized attack tools, and simulated execution environments to detect real-world vulnerabilities, unlike traditional methods that often fail to account for code execution behaviors. Experiments show RedCodeAgent consistently achieves higher attack success rates, adapts its strategies efficiently across diverse code agents and programming languages, and uncovers new vulnerabilities overlooked by other baseline methods.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.2 Adds APIs for Texas App Store Parental Consent Law</h1>
    <h2>Apple has released new developer tools to help comply with the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420), set to take effect on January 1, 2026. This law requires age confirmation for Texas Apple users, parental consent for children's App Store activities, and mandates developers to inform parents of significant app changes and allow consent revocation. To meet these requirements, Apple is adding new APIs in iOS 26.2, including features for declared age ranges, handling "significant changes" requiring re-consent, and enabling parents to revoke app access.</h2>
