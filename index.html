    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex tasks but fail at simple monitoring due to their inability to intelligently "wait" and check conditions over extended periods without wasting resources or overflowing context. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform long-running monitoring tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
