    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Research, revealed a "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems in DNA synthesis. This cross-sector effort developed and implemented robust AI-resilient screening solutions, sharing them globally to enhance biosecurity defenses against such threats. Furthermore, the project established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for managing sensitive scientific information, setting a new standard for responsible disclosure and ongoing vigilance in the face of dual-use AI technologies.</h2>

    <h1>When Will Apple's Macs Get M5 Chips? 2025-2026 Launch Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next-generation M5 silicon chip is expected to debut soon, with some new products launching by late 2025, but the majority of Mac refreshes are planned for 2026. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is rumored to be the first Mac to receive the M5 chip, potentially by the end of 2025, with other MacBook Pro models and the iMac expected in late 2025 to early 2026. New MacBook Air and Mac mini models are anticipated in early 2026, while the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, requiring M5 Max or M5 Ultra chips, are not expected until mid to late 2026.</h2>
