    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, lacking capabilities for temporal analysis and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an open-source framework that employs a Planner–Critic architecture to enable structured, iterative reasoning across diverse visual data. This agent-based system, featuring specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components with extensible toolchains, significantly enhances accuracy and provides explainable insights for complex queries.</h2>

    <h1>Here Are All the States That Support Digital Driver's Licenses in the iPhone Wallet App</h1>
    <h2>Currently, 12 U.S. states allow residents to store their driver's license or state ID in the Apple Wallet app, with several more states planning to add support. Additionally, all U.S. iPhone users can add their passport as a digital ID to Wallet. These digital IDs are accepted at most major TSA checkpoints for domestic travel and can be used for age verification, though a physical ID may still be required in some situations and specific device and OS versions are necessary.</h2>
