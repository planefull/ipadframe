    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check for updates, leading to either early abandonment or excessive resource use. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, which enables agents to complete these tasks through dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves the reliability of agents over extended periods, making them capable of patiently monitoring conditions for hours or days while remaining efficient and proactive.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Giving Vision Pro Another Chance</h1>
    <h2>This week's "The MacRumors Show" dives into the updated Apple Vision Pro headset, featuring the new M5 chip for enhanced performance and efficiency. The refreshed model boasts 10% more rendered pixels, up to 120Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, an improved counterweighted headband for comfort, and new visionOS 26 features like widgets and enhanced Personas. The episode discusses whether these significant advancements make it worthwhile to give Apple's spatial computing device another chance.</h2>
