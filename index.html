    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative team, including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, developed and globally shared "patches" to strengthen these screening tools and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" process for responsibly sharing sensitive research data. This pioneering effort highlights the dual-use challenge of AI in biotechnology, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance, proactive defense, and adaptive policies to manage evolving risks and ensure AI's safe and beneficial development.</h2>
