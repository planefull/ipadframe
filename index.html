    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to assist genetic professionals in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing. Genetic professionals face challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis, leading to low initial diagnosis rates for complex rare diseases. The study developed an AI assistant prototype designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize extensive gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Driver's Licenses Coming to North Dakota Residents</h1>
    <h2>North Dakota residents will soon be able to add their driver's licenses and state IDs to the Apple Wallet app, with the feature expected to launch imminently. These digital IDs can be used at select U.S. airports and for age verification in various settings, though users are advised to continue carrying their physical licenses as digital versions are not universally accepted. North Dakota joins several other states and territories that have already implemented or are working on supporting this feature, with a $5 fee required for residents to obtain a mobile driver's license.</h2>
