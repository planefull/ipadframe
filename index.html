    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>RedCodeAgent is the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety of large language model (LLM)-based code agents, addressing the shortcomings of traditional static safety benchmarks. It operates by combining an adaptive memory module, a specialized toolbox including code substitution, and simulated execution environments to continuously learn and refine attack strategies. This innovative approach effectively uncovers diverse vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages and code agents, outperforming existing methods in attack success rates and discovering previously unknown weaknesses.</h2>
