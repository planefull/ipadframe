    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, often failing because they don't know *when* to check for updates like email responses or price drops. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This innovation, available as part of the open-source Magentic-UI, significantly improves task reliability for longer durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and enduring AI assistants.</h2>
