    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, risk user privacy through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can track and profile individuals across various digital interactions. To counter this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that integrates "unlinkability" into widely used digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and an optimized two-stage process to allow users to selectively disclose information and verify credentials without revealing any unnecessary data or linking their separate digital activities, enhancing privacy without requiring changes to existing issuing systems.</h2>

    <h1>One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>Apple's standard iPhone 17, set to be introduced next week, will be the most affordable but arguably least interesting of the four new models, replacing the "Plus" model with a 6.3-inch display. Key upgrades include a 120Hz ProMotion display, an A19 chip with vapor chamber cooling, and an improved 24-megapixel front-facing camera, though its main rear cameras remain unchanged. The device will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support and is expected to launch on September 19th, potentially with a price increase from its current $799 base.</h2>
