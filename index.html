    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges, including information overload and complex data synthesis, when diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing, resulting in low initial diagnostic rates. To address this, Microsoft Research collaborated to design a generative AI assistant aimed at streamlining the sensemaking process in genetic analysis. This AI tool is designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize critical gene and variant information, ultimately striving to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time for rare diseases.</h2>
