    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the massive, complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis for genetic professionals. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed a generative AI-based assistant to address these obstacles by streamlining data analysis. This AI tool aims to improve diagnosis rates and patient outcomes by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new findings, and aggregating critical gene and variant information.</h2>
