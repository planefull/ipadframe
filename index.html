    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," which allows various credential uses to be associated with a specific person and build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information without revealing linking identifiers, thereby protecting privacy and preventing tracking across separate interactions, all without requiring credential issuers to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Warns UK Risks Feature Delays Under Proposed Competition Rules</h1>
    <h2>Apple has warned that UK users could face delayed product features if regulators proceed with "EU-style rules" designed to increase competition against big tech companies. The proposed regulations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would require Apple to allow alternative payment systems and improve interoperability, which Apple claims undermines user privacy and security, citing past feature delays in the EU like Apple Intelligence. However, the CMA rejects Apple's characterization, asserting that its specific regulations will foster innovation for UK developers without compromising security.</h2>
