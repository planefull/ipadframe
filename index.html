    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, struggled to efficiently provide accurate technical information to professional users due to its vast and complex product documentation. To overcome this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their Microsoft Azure-based knowledge management system. This implementation resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 18 Pro May Drop Rear Two-Tone Appearance for a Unified Look</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 18 Pro models are rumored to drop the current two-tone rear aesthetic, aiming for a more seamless and unified look. This shift would minimize the color difference between the aluminum frame and the Ceramic Shield back glass, which currently gives the iPhone 17 Pro its distinct dual-tone appearance around the MagSafe cutout. The information stems from Chinese leaker Instant Digital, whose past leaks have sometimes been accurate, and could align with previous rumors of a "slightly transparent" Ceramic Shield.</h2>
