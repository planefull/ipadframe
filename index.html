    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems in DNA synthesis, posing a significant dual-use risk. A cross-sector team, led by Microsoft Research, developed an AI-based red-teaming pipeline to demonstrate this evasion and subsequently created "patches" that were shared globally to fortify biosecurity screening. This collaborative effort not only enhanced AI-resilient biosecurity but also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible disclosure of sensitive research findings, setting a model for addressing future dual-use technology challenges.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple is expected to release an updated Developer Strap for its Vision Pro next week, with its availability hinted for October 22, coinciding with the launch of the M5 Vision Pro. This optional accessory provides a USB-C connection between the Vision Pro and a Mac, crucial for app development and diagnostic purposes for Apple Developer Program members. While the current strap is limited to USB 2.0 speeds, details on new features, pricing, or compatibility with older Vision Pro models for the updated version remain unknown.</h2>
