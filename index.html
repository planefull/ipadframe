    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks like "linkability," where hidden identifiers in credentials allow for tracking and profiling of user behavior across different online activities. To counter this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs and optimized for efficiency, Crescent ensures that users can prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing any information that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring updates to existing issuer systems.</h2>
