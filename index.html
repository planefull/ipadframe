    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like watching for emails or price drops because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability and efficiency over extended durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and patient AI assistants, and is now open-sourced as part of Magentic-UI.</h2>
