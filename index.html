    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases using whole genome sequencing is complex and often yields low initial success rates due to challenges like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore how generative AI could support genetic professionals in these intensive sensemaking tasks. They designed an AI assistant prototype aimed at flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>
