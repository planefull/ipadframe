    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is increasingly limited by network and memory bottlenecks, driven by a fundamental trade-off between the short reach of power-efficient copper links and the high power consumption and lower reliability of longer-reach optical fibers. To address this, Microsoft developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology using a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed microLED channels. This approach delivers low power, high reliability, and long reach (up to 50 meters) simultaneously, promising significant energy savings, reduced failure rates, and the ability to unlock more scalable and efficient AI infrastructure designs.</h2>

    <h1>Skipping the iPhone 17 Pro? Here's What's Rumored for iPhone 18 Pro</h1>
    <h2>Rumors for the upcoming iPhone 18 Pro models suggest significant upgrades, including the potential debut of under-screen Face ID, which could lead to a smaller Dynamic Island. The main 48-megapixel camera is also expected to feature a variable aperture, offering users greater control over light and depth of field. Furthermore, these devices are anticipated to be powered by a new 2nm A20 Pro chip for enhanced performance and Apple's power-efficient C2 cellular modem.</h2>
