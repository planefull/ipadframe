    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and profiled. To counter this, Microsoft Research has introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent uses zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing identifiable data or linking their various online interactions, all without requiring extensive changes to existing infrastructure.</h2>

    <h1>AirTag 2 May Debut at iPhone 17 Event Next Week With These Features</h1>
    <h2>The long-awaited AirTag 2 is rumored to debut at Apple's annual iPhone event next week, over four years after the original AirTag was introduced. Key rumored features include a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for up to three times longer tracking range and a more tamper-proof built-in speaker for enhanced safety. The new AirTag is also expected to offer "very low" battery life alerts and Vision Pro integration, while retaining a similar design and a replaceable coin battery.</h2>
