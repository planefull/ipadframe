    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases due to the vast, complex data from whole genome sequencing and the time-consuming process of synthesizing information, leading to low diagnostic rates. Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute conducted a study to explore how generative AI can assist these professionals. They co-designed an AI assistant prototype aimed at flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and aggregating/synthesizing gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes for rare genetic diseases.</h2>
