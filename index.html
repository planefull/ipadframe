    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that allows agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context. Implemented in their Magentic-UI system, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents on these extended tasks, enabling more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
