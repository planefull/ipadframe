    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the Paraphrase Project, which investigated how AI tools for protein design could be misused to create toxic proteins that evade existing biosecurity screening systems. Researchers, including Microsoft, IBBIS, and Twist Bioscience, demonstrated this "zero-day" vulnerability by generating thousands of AI-rewritten toxic protein variants (e.g., ricin) that bypassed current defenses. This led to the development and implementation of a more robust, AI-resilient protein screening system shared globally, alongside a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsibly managing sensitive scientific information.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Max 2: Everything We Know So Far</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation AirPods Max are anticipated to launch in 2027, with the primary confirmed change being a lighter design compared to the current model. These new headphones are expected to feature Apple's H2 or H3 chip, bringing advanced capabilities like Adaptive Audio, IP57 water resistance, lossless audio support, and a U2 chip for Precision Finding. A refreshed design for the headphones and their Smart Case is also likely, with the significant delay attributed to the product's "commercial limbo" status.</h2>
