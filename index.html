    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, such as ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed and implemented "patches"—more robust screening methods and a novel perpetual gatekeeping approach for sensitive information—to significantly strengthen biosecurity defenses. This initiative demonstrated a proactive cybersecurity-style response to AI's dual-use dilemma in synthetic biology, setting a precedent for handling information hazards and fostering collaboration to mitigate catastrophic risks posed by emerging technologies.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</h1>
    <h2>Apple is preparing to launch MacBook Air models with the new M5 chip in spring 2026, while M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models are expected earlier that year. These initial M5 updates will feature chip upgrades without significant design changes, though a major MacBook Pro refresh with an OLED touch screen is planned for late 2026 or early 2027. Additionally, Apple is developing new Mac Studio, Mac mini, and external display models, which are also expected to receive M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.</h2>
