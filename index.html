    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine *when* to check, leading to either premature failure or excessive resource usage. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, allowing them to proactively monitor conditions and act efficiently without wasting resources.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Wins Partial Dismissal in First-Gen AirPods Pro Crackling Lawsuit</h1>
    <h2>Apple recently received a partial dismissal in a class action lawsuit concerning first-generation AirPods Pro models that experienced crackling or static issues. The judge threw out many claims, including some related to state fraud, consumer law, and warranties, but did not dismiss the entire case. Crucially, a fraud by omission claim survived, allowing plaintiffs to pursue allegations that Apple failed to disclose known defects even after acknowledging them publicly.</h2>
