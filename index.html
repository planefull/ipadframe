    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to complex technical inquiries due to a vast array of product models, diverse documentation formats, and multimodal data. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system on Azure. This advanced RAG system excels at multimodal document parsing, establishes an end-to-end knowledge loop from original sources, and performs dynamic multi-hop reasoning. The integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy for Signify, showcasing PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial knowledge management.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store With All-New Design Opening on Long Island This Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, New York, is set to reopen on Friday, November 21, following extensive renovations that include a modern design with more wood paneling. The store, originally opened in 2002, was closed for about a year during the overhaul, with a temporary location operating in its place. This reopening is part of a broader trend, as Apple is actively renovating several other U.S. stores and recently completed work on locations in Texas and Australia.</h2>
