    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research introduces MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent designed to overcome the limitations of current AI models in processing long-form video and large-scale image collections. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent uses a Planner–Critic architecture and modality-specific agents to enable iterative, tool-based reasoning for complex tasks requiring temporal understanding and cross-modal grounding. This framework significantly improves performance on multimodal benchmarks by integrating structured ingestion, retrieval, and self-evaluation, offering a scalable and extensible solution for real-world visual reasoning applications.</h2>

    <h1>When to Expect the iPhone Air 2 and 20th Anniversary iPhone With Camera Under Screen</h1>
    <h2>According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans to release a second-generation iPhone Air around March 2027, followed by a 20th-anniversary iPhone in September 2027. The anniversary iPhone is expected to feature a curved glass screen with a hidden under-screen front camera, while the iPhone Air 2 may include a 2nm chip, larger battery, and vapor chamber cooling. Gurman indicates the iPhone Air 2 was always slated for 2027 and suggests Apple might proceed with it despite reportedly low demand for the current iPhone Air model.</h2>
