    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers can connect separate uses of credentials (like app logins or mobile driver's licenses) to build detailed user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, which allow users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary data or linking separate interactions, all while being efficient enough for mobile devices and not requiring infrastructure changes from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's C1 Modem Put Through New Speed Test Ahead of iPhone 17 Air</h1>
    <h2>Ookla's second speed test for the iPhone 16e, equipped with Apple's custom C1 modem, found its cellular performance generally comparable to the standard iPhone 16 with a Qualcomm modem. While results showed some variation depending on the carrier and country, with specific networks showing the 16e both slightly faster and slower, the overall conclusion remained consistent with earlier findings. This reinforces that Apple's first 5G modem is a capable performer, which bodes well for its expected inclusion in future devices like the iPhone 17 Air.</h2>
