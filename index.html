    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnostic rates and time-consuming reanalysis for rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute designed and studied a generative AI-based assistant to enhance the complex "sensemaking" tasks involved. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing diagnosis time for patients.</h2>
