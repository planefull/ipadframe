    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to address the limitations of current AI models in analyzing complex, long-form video and large image datasets. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent utilizes a Planner–Critic architecture with modality-specific agents and tools to enable iterative reasoning, self-evaluation, and refinement for multimodal question-answering. This agentic approach significantly enhances performance on benchmarks, providing scalable, explainable, and extensible reasoning across vast visual data collections.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Extended Return Policy Now in Effect for 2025 Holiday Season</h1>
    <h2>Apple has activated its extended return policy for the 2025 holiday shopping season, covering most products purchased online or in stores. For many countries, items bought between November 12 and December 25 can be returned until January 8, 2026, with some regions extending the window to January 20, 2026, though carrier-financed iPhones are typically excluded. Additionally, Apple's online store now features holiday gift recommendations, including older products like the HomePod mini and Apple TV, despite existing inventory concerns and past update rumors.</h2>
