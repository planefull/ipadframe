    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a "zero-day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A cross-sector team developed red-teaming methods to test and strengthen these defenses, resulting in more AI-resilient screening solutions that were shared globally. This project highlights the dual-use nature of AI in biology and demonstrates a proactive, collaborative approach to mitigating risks, including a novel strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific data.</h2>

    <h1>Facebook's New Collage Feature May Use Your Images for AI Training</h1>
    <h2>Meta is rolling out a new opt-in AI-based collage and photo editing tool for Facebook, initially available to users in the U.S. and Canada. This feature scans your camera roll, uploads images to the cloud, and uses AI to suggest private collages and edits, which can then be shared in Stories and Feed. Users should be aware that sharing these AI-generated creations will allow Facebook to use their images for AI training, making privacy settings an important consideration.</h2>
