    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, failing to efficiently track conditions over extended periods due to issues with knowing *when* to check and managing context. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to complete such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more practical, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iFixit's Teardown of New iPad Pro With M5 Chip Reveals 'Repair Paradox'</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the new iPad Pro with the M5 chip revealed a "repair paradox," as the device remains one of Apple's least-repairable, yet received a provisional repairability score of 5/10. This higher score is attributed to Apple's recent introduction of self-service repair parts and manuals for iPads, which will eventually include this specific M5 model. The teardown confirmed no significant internal design changes beyond the M5 chip, as it was primarily a spec-bump update.</h2>
