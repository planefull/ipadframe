    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the immense and complex data from whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI assistant designed to support genetic professionals in synthesizing vast biomedical data. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency by flagging cases for reanalysis and aggregating critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving patient outcomes for rare diseases.</h2>
