    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, difficulties in collaboration, and prioritizing case reanalysis, resulting in low diagnosis rates. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore and design a generative AI-based assistant to support these complex sensemaking tasks. This AI prototype aims to enhance diagnostic workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving patient outcomes and shortening diagnosis times.</h2>
