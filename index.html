    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Research, revealed a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins in ways that evaded existing biosecurity screening systems. Through a collaborative red-teaming effort, the team developed and implemented "patches" to create more robust protein screening systems, which were then shared globally with gene synthesis companies. This initiative not only strengthened biosecurity defenses but also introduced a novel, perpetually gatekept approach to responsible data and software sharing for sensitive research, highlighting the ongoing need for vigilance against dual-use AI technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Home Hub Could Cost $350</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to launch a new home hub with an iPad-like 7-inch display and an indoor security camera in 2026, followed by a tabletop robot featuring a 9-inch screen and motorized arm in 2027. The home hub, designed to run apps, control smart home devices, and offer FaceTime calls with person recognition, is expected to cost around $350. Manufacturing of these smart home devices will occur in Vietnam with BYD, aiming to reduce Apple's reliance on China, with the home hub's launch delayed until 2026 because an updated Siri was not yet ready.</h2>
