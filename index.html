    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI system performance is currently limited by memory and network bottlenecks due to a fundamental trade-off in existing copper and optical communication technologies, which are either short-reach and power-efficient or long-reach but power-hungry and less reliable. Microsoft Research has developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology utilizing a "wide-and-slow" architecture with microLEDs, designed to simultaneously provide low power, high reliability, and extended reach of up to 50 meters. This breakthrough offers significant power savings (up to 68%) and vastly improved reliability, promising to overcome the "networking wall" and enable more scalable and efficient AI infrastructure designs.</h2>
