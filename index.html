    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz, uncovered a "zero day" vulnerability where open-source AI tools could redesign toxic proteins, like ricin, to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems. In response, a cross-sector team adopted a cybersecurity-style approach, developing and implementing more robust protein screening methods and sharing these "patches" with DNA synthesis companies worldwide. Published in *Science*, this effort established a novel framework for responsible vulnerability disclosure and collaborative defense, underscoring the ongoing need for proactive biosecurity measures and innovative governance as AI capabilities in biology advance.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26 Liquid Glass Design Copied by Android Smartphone Maker</h1>
    <h2>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has unveiled OriginOS 6, its latest operating system update, which heavily draws inspiration from Apple's "Liquid Glass" design language found in iOS 26. The new OS features strikingly similar visual elements, including rounded glass-like buttons, translucent interfaces, squircle icons, and dynamic wallpapers that shift with a 2D to 3D effect. Despite Vivo's own marketing using water analogies, the interface is so alike that a demo video shows an OriginOS 6 device easily mistakable for an iOS 26 device.</h2>
