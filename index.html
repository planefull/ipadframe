    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex product data across diverse, multimodal documents. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration significantly improved answer accuracy by 12% through advanced multimodal document parsing, multi-hop reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge adaptation, setting a new standard for professional Q&A systems.</h2>
