    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI struggles with complex reasoning over long-form videos and vast image libraries, limited by single-pass inference and short context windows. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture that enables iterative, tool-based reasoning. This framework utilizes specialized agents, like VideoAgent and ImageAgent, to process and understand extensive visual data, significantly improving performance on multimodal benchmarks by augmenting models with capabilities like object detection and OCR.</h2>
