    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," allowing hidden identifiers to track user behavior across different credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs with pre-processing to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials efficiently, all without revealing linking identifiers or requiring changes to existing issuing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Rivian Activates Apple Car Key Support in Second-Generation Vehicles</h1>
    <h2>EV manufacturer Rivian is finally activating support for Apple's digital car keys in its second-generation R1S and R1T vehicles, a feature that was announced over a year ago. This integration allows iPhone and Apple Watch users to unlock their cars via the Wallet app using NFC or Ultra Wideband, providing features like key sharing and Express Mode. While Rivian continues to resist adding Apple CarPlay, this rollout joins integrated Apple Music as another Apple feature adopted by the company.</h2>
