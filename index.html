    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to address challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing. Genetic professionals face significant hurdles like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis, resulting in low initial diagnostic rates. The study developed and prototyped an AI assistant designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by fostering collaborative and multimodal AI-human sensemaking.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro Teardown Reveals Apple's New Approach to Thermal Management and Repairs</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the iPhone 17 Pro highlights a new vapor chamber cooling system for the A19 Pro chip, which effectively prevents overheating and throttling, a significant improvement over previous models. While the battery is secured by screws in a tray, potentially easing future replacements, the overall design is less repairable than the iPhone 16 Pro due to the removal of dual-entry access. Despite this, and a scratch-prone camera plateau, the iPhone 17 Pro earned a repairability score of 7 out of 10, partly due to Apple providing repair manuals.</h2>
