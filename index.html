    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in its knowledge management system, struggling to efficiently provide accurate answers to professional users due to vast product data and complex technical documentation. To address this, Signify collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology, integrating it into their Microsoft Azure-based system. This advanced RAG solution, which processes multimodal documents and performs multi-hop reasoning, improved answer accuracy by 12% and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial knowledge across various sectors.</h2>
