    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that revolutionizes 3D rendering by learning the entire graphics pipeline through machine learning, eliminating the need for traditional physics-based computations. This transformer-based model utilizes triangle tokens for scene geometry and material data, and ray bundle tokens for viewing direction, processed by dual transformers to handle both view-independent and view-dependent effects like global illumination. RenderFormer's ability to render complex 3D scenes with realistic lighting entirely with AI represents a significant leap forward, offering greater generalizability and paving the way for its integration into broader AI systems for diverse visual computing applications.</h2>

    <h1>Here's When iPhone 17 Pre-Orders Begin in Every Time Zone</h1>
    <h2>Pre-orders for the new iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will begin on Friday, September 12, at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time, launching simultaneously across multiple countries. The article provides a detailed list of pre-order times for various global locations, with U.S. customers able to prepare in advance using a "Get Ready" setup. Due to uncertain supply, immediate pre-ordering is recommended to secure a device, with the first deliveries scheduled for Friday, September 19.</h2>
