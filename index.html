    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in analyzing vast whole genome sequencing data to diagnose rare genetic diseases, resulting in low diagnosis rates and lengthy waits for patients. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI-based assistant designed to enhance these professionals' "sensemaking" tasks. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing complex gene and variant information, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and shortening the time to diagnosis for rare disease patients.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Responds to U.S. Class Action Lawsuit Over Delayed Siri Features</h1>
    <h2>Apple has filed a motion to dismiss a U.S. class-action lawsuit concerning delayed Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence. Plaintiffs claim they would not have bought an iPhone 16, or would have paid less, if they had known these advertised features would be delayed. Apple's lawyers argue that the delay of only two Siri features cannot support the broad claims, especially since many other Apple Intelligence features and hardware improvements were delivered.</h2>
