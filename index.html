    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the "Paraphrase Project," a Microsoft Research initiative exploring the dual-use nature of AI in protein design and its implications for biosecurity. Researchers discovered that open-source AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, enabling them to bypass existing biosecurity screening systemsâ€”a "zero day" vulnerability. Through a collaborative, cybersecurity-style response, the project developed and implemented "patches" that led to a more robust protein screening system and a novel approach to peer review for handling sensitive research, subsequently shared worldwide to strengthen global biosecurity.</h2>

    <h1>AT&T Website References Next-Generation iPad Pro With M5 Chip</h1>
    <h2>AT&T's website briefly displayed a Google search result title referencing an unreleased "iPad Pro M5," sparking speculation about Apple's next-generation tablet. While no actual product listing exists on AT&T's site, it's unclear if this was an accidental leak or a premature SEO move. This aligns with existing rumors that Apple is expected to update the iPad Pro with an M5 chip as early as this month.</h2>
