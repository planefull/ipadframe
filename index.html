    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for hours or days effectively. This innovation significantly improves agent reliability for extended tasks, paving the way for more patient, proactive, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Some AirPods Pro 3 Owners Complain About Static Noise</h1>
    <h2>Some AirPods Pro 3 owners are experiencing a static-like sound, described as a hiss, white noise, or ocean-like, when Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive, or Transparency modes are engaged without media playing. This issue, reported on Reddit and MacRumors forums, can vary in intensity, sometimes amplifying high frequencies or being more pronounced in one AirPod. While not all units are affected and some users have received replacements with mixed results, Apple is reportedly exchanging affected AirPods Pro 3, though the cause (hardware or software) remains unclear.</h2>
