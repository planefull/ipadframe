    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," allowing user activities to be tracked across various credential uses. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using efficient zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose information and prevent their separate digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring issuing organizations to update their systems.</h2>
