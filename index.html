    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a global leader in LED lighting, faced challenges in providing accurate and efficient technical answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse technical documentation. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into their knowledge management system, built on Microsoft Azure. This implementation led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, end-to-end knowledge loops, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating PIKE-RAG's strong generalization capabilities for complex industrial knowledge.</h2>

    <h1>Happy 24th Anniversary, iPod</h1>
    <h2>The first-generation iPod launched on November 10, 2001, following a period of pre-release speculation that often misidentified its nature as a simple MP3 player. Despite initial criticisms regarding its price and Mac-only compatibility, the iPod quickly became a wildly popular device that revolutionized portable music and storage, influencing a line of subsequent models and the development of the iPhone. Apple officially discontinued the iPod line in 2022, but its "spirit" continues to inspire current Apple products, and a future home hub might even pay homage to its legacy.</h2>
