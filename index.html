    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," featured on the Microsoft Research Podcast, uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, dubbed the first "zero-day" in AI and biosecurity. A cross-sector team, including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, and IBBIS, developed and disseminated robust screening updates to address these AI-generated threats, strengthening global biosecurity. This pioneering effort also established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" model for responsible data and software sharing, setting a precedent for managing information hazards in other dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Expected to Announce These Two to Three Products 'This Week'</h1>
    <h2>According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is expected to announce new products "this week" without holding a major event. These anticipated updates include the iPad Pro, Vision Pro, and likely the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, all featuring the next-generation M5 chip. The announcements are expected via press releases and promotional videos, potentially starting as early as Tuesday due to holidays.</h2>
