    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that replaces traditional 3D rendering techniques with an end-to-end machine learning approach. This model uses triangle tokens to represent 3D scenes and dual transformers to handle both view-independent (e.g., shadows) and view-dependent (e.g., reflections) rendering effects. RenderFormer is significant as the first neural network capable of learning a complete graphics rendering pipeline, including arbitrary 3D scenes and global illumination, which has broad implications for future AI, graphics, and visual computing applications.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: What's Exclusive to Apple's Largest Flagship iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Despite earlier rumors suggesting exclusive features for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, both new models share the same general capabilities this year. The main differences between the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are related to size, with the Pro Max featuring a larger 6.9-inch display compared to the Pro's 6.3-inch screen. Consequently, the Pro Max offers a longer battery life of up to 39 hours of video playback and introduces a new 2TB storage option not available on the Pro.</h2>
