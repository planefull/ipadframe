    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, discussed in this Microsoft Research podcast, exposed a critical biosecurity vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, allowing them to bypass existing screening systems of DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed and implemented more robust protein screening solutions (patches) which were shared globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium. The project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive scientific data and software, aiming to balance open science with mitigating information hazards for future dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Smart Glasses With In-Lens Display May Feature Two Modes</h1>
    <h2>Apple's second-generation smart glasses are rumored to feature an in-lens display and two distinct operating modes: a full visionOS experience when connected to a Mac, and a lightweight, mobile-friendly interface when paired with an iPhone. According to Mark Gurman, Apple's first smart glasses, anticipated to launch around 2027, will not include an in-lens display but will offer speakers, cameras, voice control, and potential health features. These glasses will aim to compete with existing devices such as the Meta Ray-Bans.</h2>
