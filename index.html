    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, resulting in information overload and delayed reanalysis of unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaborated on a study to design a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool is intended to streamline the interpretation of genetic data by synthesizing information about genes and variants and flagging cases for reanalysis, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.</h2>
