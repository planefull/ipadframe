    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce significant privacy risks like "linkability," allowing various online activities to be tracked and associated with individuals. To combat this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose necessary information without revealing any identifiers that could link their separate digital interactions, all while being efficient for mobile use and compatible with existing infrastructure.</h2>
