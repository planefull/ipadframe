    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, resulting in low diagnosis rates and prolonged suffering for patients with rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline workflows. This AI tool flags cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizes crucial gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Smart Glasses: Five Key Features to Expect</h1>
    <h2>Apple is prioritizing the development of smart glasses to rival Meta's offerings, even pausing work on the next Vision Pro to speed up their release. These fashion-forward glasses will heavily integrate an advanced Siri for voice controls, enabling features like photography, video recording, and AI assistance, though they will lack a display and require an iPhone for full functionality. Expected to debut as early as late 2026, the glasses will offer customizable frame options and aim for competitive pricing.</h2>
