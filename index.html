    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in analyzing vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnosis rates and prolonged diagnostic journeys for rare genetic diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI-based assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing complex biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and ultimately increasing diagnostic yield to improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook's Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</h1>
    <h2>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has withdrawn most of its claims against Apple concerning a 2021 email sent by CEO Tim Cook. The email warned employees about leaking confidential information, which the NLRB had initially alleged violated U.S. labor law by potentially interfering with workers' rights. This action concludes the NLRB's targeting of Apple over the email, including claims related to confidentiality rules and employee surveillance.</h2>
