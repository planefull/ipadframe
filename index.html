    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to efficiently manage polling frequency and context over extended periods. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, designed to enable agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals based on the task and carefully managing agent state to prevent context overflow, significantly improving the reliability of agents on longer-duration tasks.</h2>

    <h1>The MacRumors Show: Giving Vision Pro Another Chance</h1>
    <h2>The latest episode of The MacRumors Show revisits Apple's Vision Pro headset, focusing on its significant updates. The new Vision Pro features an M5 chip for enhanced performance, a 120Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, and a redesigned headband for improved comfort, alongside visionOS 26 which introduces new features like widgets and better Personas. The podcast discusses whether these improvements make it time to give Apple's spatial computing device another chance.</h2>
