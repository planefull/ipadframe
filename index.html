    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections due to limitations in temporal context and iterative processing. To overcome this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This system, featuring modality-specific agents like VideoAgent and ImageAgent, enhances base model performance by integrating specialized tools and a self-evaluation loop, significantly improving accuracy and scalability for diverse visual data analysis.</h2>

    <h1>Another Designer Leaves Apple</h1>
    <h2>Abidur Chowdhury, the designer who introduced the iPhone Air and was considered a rising star, has departed Apple to join an AI startup, a move that reportedly "made waves" internally. His departure is part of a broader trend of high-profile industrial designers leaving Apple since Jony Ive's exit in 2019, further depleting the ranks of those who worked under Ive. Following former operations chief Jeff Williams' recent retirement, Apple's design team will now report directly to CEO Tim Cook, marking a significant leadership shift.</h2>
