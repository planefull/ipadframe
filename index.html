    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose privacy risks due to "linkability," which allows hidden identifiers to track user activities across various digital interactions. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs with a two-stage process (prepare and show) to efficiently enable users to selectively disclose necessary information and prevent their separate digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
