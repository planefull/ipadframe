    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast amounts of complex whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and long waits for patients. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to design a generative AI assistant that supports genetic professionals in their "sensemaking" tasks. This AI tool aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing critical gene and variant information, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</h2>
