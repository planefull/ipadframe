    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate credential uses to be associated and user profiles built. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs to enable selective disclosure of information without revealing linking data, ensuring user privacy without requiring credential issuers to update their systems, and is optimized for efficient mobile use.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Air is Launching Soon, Here Are All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is poised to be Apple's most significant iPhone design overhaul since 2017, featuring an ultra-thin 5.5mm profile, a lighter hybrid titanium-aluminum frame, and a 6.6-inch 120Hz LTPO OLED display with 30% improved brightness. It will be powered by an A19 or A19 Pro chip with 12GB RAM, include a 48-megapixel single rear camera, a 24-megapixel front camera, and support Wi-Fi 7 and 25W Qi 2.2 wireless charging. However, its slim design may lead to a smaller 2,800mAh battery and it won't support mmWave 5G, with an estimated price of $899.</h2>
