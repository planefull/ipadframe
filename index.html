    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article introduces "tool-space interference," a challenge emerging as AI agents increasingly rely on diverse, horizontally integrated tools through protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), moving beyond vertically integrated systems. This interference manifests as reduced agent effectiveness due to issues like an overwhelming number of tools, overly long responses, complex parameter schemas, naming collisions, and poor error messaging. To mitigate these problems, the authors recommend implementing formal namespaces, improving resource sharing conventions, promoting transparent server documentation, and encouraging client-side optimizations and marketplace standardization for a more compatible and scalable AI agent ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone Air MagSafe Battery Pack Uses Same Battery as iPhone Air</h1>
    <h2>iFixit's teardown of the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery pack revealed that its internal battery is likely the same one found in the iPhone Air. This battery has a 12.26Wh capacity and is thin enough for the iPhone Air, though wireless charging limits the MagSafe pack to charging the phone to 65% due to energy loss. The MagSafe pack itself is thicker than the iPhone Air and lacks its titanium frame, with iFixit speculating its size was the minimum needed for a viable product.</h2>
