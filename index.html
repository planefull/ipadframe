    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses "tool-space interference," a new challenge arising as diverse AI agents and tools increasingly collaborate through protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). While MCP enables broad horizontal integration and extends agent capabilities, this leads to issues such as overwhelming tool counts, excessively long responses, complex parameters, naming conflicts, and poor error handling, which collectively degrade agent performance and increase costs. To address these problems, the authors recommend implementing formal namespaces, enhancing resource sharing, improving server documentation, and developing client-side optimizations to foster a more interoperable, scalable, and efficient AI agent ecosystem.</h2>

    <h1>'A New Story': Apple Store in Tokyo Returning to Original 2003 Location</h1>
    <h2>After more than three years in a temporary spot, the Apple Ginza store is returning to its original location in Tokyo, following the demolition and rebuilding of its former site. The temporary store will permanently close on September 22nd, with the new store at the original Ginza 3-ch≈çme location expected to open "soon," likely in the second half of 2025. To mark this occasion, Apple has released a special wallpaper, celebrating the return of its first retail store ever opened outside the United States.</h2>
