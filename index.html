    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to intelligently wait and check for specific conditions, leading to inefficient resource use or task failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to handle such tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Pro First Impressions</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro features an identical design to the M4 model but includes an updated 3-nanometer M5 chip with a 10-core CPU and GPU. Benchmarks reveal modest performance improvements, with the M5 showing up to 15% faster CPU speeds, 30% faster GPU speeds, and double the SSD speeds compared to the M4. While the M5 offers little noticeable difference for everyday tasks and isn't worth upgrading from an M4, it provides a significant performance boost for users coming from older M-series or Intel MacBook Pros, particularly for intensive tasks like video editing.</h2>
