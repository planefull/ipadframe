    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents excel at complex analytical tasks but fail at simple monitoring activities due to their inability to efficiently manage long-running checks without excessive polling or context overflow. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism within their Magentic-UI agentic system that enables agents to perform monitoring tasks for hours or days. SentinelStep dynamically adjusts polling intervals and manages context, significantly improving agent reliability on longer tasks and paving the way for more patient, proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.1 Beta Liquid Glass Battery Drain Test: Tinted vs Clear Mode</h1>
    <h2>In the fourth iOS 26.1 beta, an author tested whether the new "Tinted" Liquid Glass option or other accessibility settings like Reduce Transparency and Reduce Motion impact battery life. Using an iPhone 17 Pro Max, they conducted multiple 2.5-hour tests simulating typical phone usage with different Liquid Glass configurations. The tests concluded that these Liquid Glass-related settings made no meaningful difference in battery consumption, suggesting they are primarily for visual preference rather than battery savings.</h2>
