    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a new neural architecture that revolutionizes 3D rendering by replacing traditional physics-based techniques with machine learning. This model is the first to demonstrate a complete graphics rendering pipeline, including support for arbitrary 3D scenes and global illumination, entirely through a neural network without relying on ray tracing or rasterization. RenderFormer utilizes a dual-branch transformer design to effectively capture both view-independent and view-dependent rendering effects, paving the way for future AI-driven visual computing advancements.</h2>

    <h1>You Don't Need the Apple Watch Series 11 to Get Your Sleep Score</h1>
    <h2>Apple's new Sleep Score feature, part of watchOS 26 and found in the Health app, provides an actionable overview of your sleep quality. It rates sleep as Excellent, High, OK, Low, or Very Low, with scores calculated based on sleep duration, bedtime, and nighttime interruptions. Crucially, this feature works on older Apple Watch models and even some third-party devices that log data to the Health app, not just the new Series 11, and launches publicly on September 15.</h2>
