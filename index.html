    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases efficiently due to the immense complexity and data overload of whole genome sequencing, leading to low initial diagnostic rates. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to support these professionals in interpreting vast genetic data. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information from scientific literature.</h2>

    <h1>New MacBook Pro Nears Mass Production, But Four Bigger Upgrades Expected Next Year</h1>
    <h2>Apple's next MacBook Pro models are reportedly nearing mass production, with a release expected between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. These initial models are anticipated to feature M5, M5 Pro, or M5 Max chips but no other major design changes. More significant upgrades, including an OLED display, touch screen, thinner design, M6 chips, and cellular connectivity, are rumored for a later MacBook Pro refresh in late 2026.</h2>
