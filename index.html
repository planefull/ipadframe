    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research *Ideas* podcast episode highlights the "Paraphrase Project," which investigated how AI-powered protein design tools could be misused to create toxic proteins capable of bypassing existing biosecurity screening systems, effectively demonstrating a "zero day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team then developed a cybersecurity-style response, creating a more robust protein screening system and sharing these "patches" with organizations worldwide. This project also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive scientific data, aiming to balance open science with minimizing information hazards in the face of evolving AI and biosecurity risks.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to launch M5-equipped MacBook Air models in spring 2026, following M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models earlier that year, with these initial updates focused on chip upgrades rather than design changes. However, significant design refreshes are anticipated for the MacBook Pro in late 2026/early 2027, introducing thinner OLED touch screens, while the MacBook Air may receive display and design tweaks around 2027. Additionally, new versions of the Mac Studio, Mac mini, and two external displays (including a second-generation Studio Display) are also in development, likely with M5 series chips.</h2>
