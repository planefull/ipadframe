    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its recent paper on generative AI's occupational implications, emphasizing that the study identified areas where AI chatbots could assist with tasks, not predict job elimination. The research found AI most useful for knowledge-based and communication tasks like writing and gathering information, highlighting its potential as a tool to enhance workflows in various occupations. The article also stressed the study's limitations, noting that jobs involve more than just tasks and the research only covered AI chatbot usage, urging nuanced interpretation of AI's broader societal and economic impact.</h2>

    <h1>From iPhone 17 Air to iPhone 20: Apple's Redesign Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans a significant iPhone design overhaul over the next three years, leading to a radically different "iPhone 20" for its 20th anniversary in 2027. In 2025, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will debut, followed by the first foldable iPhone in 2026, featuring dual displays and a very slim profile when unfolded. The 2027 "iPhone 20" is expected to showcase an all-glass design with a wraparound, bezel-less display, eliminating all edges and cutouts.</h2>
