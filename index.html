    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to help genetic professionals diagnose rare diseases more efficiently. They identified key challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis, such as information overload, difficulty in collaborative sharing, and prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. The study proposes an AI assistant that can flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis time.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26: Create Polls in the Messages App</h1>
    <h2>In iOS 26, Apple has finally added a long-requested poll feature to its Messages app, allowing users to create interactive polls within conversations. Users can add up to 12 choices, and participants can easily vote, add their own options, and view detailed breakdowns of who voted for what. Creating a poll is straightforward via the '+' button, and devices with Apple Intelligence will even suggest polls in relevant group chats, though iOS 26 or iPadOS 26 is required for all participants to interact with them.</h2>
