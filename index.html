    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that significantly advances 3D rendering by replacing traditional physics-based methods with machine learning. This new model is the first to learn a complete graphics rendering pipeline, handling arbitrary 3D scenes and global illumination entirely through a dual-branch transformer network, eliminating the need for ray tracing or rasterization. RenderFormer represents a major step toward fully ML-based rendering, offering potential for integration into broader AI systems like video generation and robotics, despite challenges in scaling to more complex scenes.</h2>
