    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that fully replaces traditional 3D rendering with machine learning, eliminating the need for physics-based techniques like ray tracing or rasterization. This model leverages triangle tokens for scene geometry and materials, and ray bundle tokens for viewing directions, processing them through dual-branch transformers to handle both view-independent and view-dependent rendering effects. RenderFormer represents a significant breakthrough for neural rendering, demonstrating deep learning's capability to learn a complete graphics pipeline, support arbitrary 3D inputs with global illumination, and serve as a foundation for future AI integrations in visual computing.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: What's Exclusive to Apple's Largest Flagship iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Despite initial rumors suggesting exclusive features for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, both the Pro and Pro Max models share the same general feature set this year. The key differences are size-related: the Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display, a longer battery life offering up to 39 hours of video playback, and an exclusive 2TB storage option. Thus, choosing the smaller iPhone 17 Pro means missing out only on these size-dependent advantages.</h2>
