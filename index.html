    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Existing multimodal AI models struggle with complex real-world reasoning over long-form video and large image collections, due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner–Critic architecture. This agentic framework leverages modality-specific tools and an iterative reasoning loop to improve accuracy, provide explainability, and significantly enhance performance for complex visual understanding tasks across extensive datasets.</h2>
