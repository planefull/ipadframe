    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack the ability to know *when* to check for updates, leading to inefficient resource use or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI agentic system, designed to enable agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. SentinelStep achieves this by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context overflow, significantly improving task reliability over extended durations, as validated by initial tests on synthetic web environments.</h2>

    <h1>iFixit Tears Down M5 MacBook Pro</h1>
    <h2>iFixit performed a teardown of Apple's new M5 MacBook Pro, revealing few major changes from its predecessor beyond the new chip and faster SSD. The device largely maintains its poor repairability, with battery replacement being particularly difficult as it requires extensive disassembly and Apple sells the battery as part of the main chassis. Despite a minor improvement in accessing some battery tabs, iFixit ultimately gave the M5 MacBook Pro a low repairability score of 4 out of 10.</h2>
