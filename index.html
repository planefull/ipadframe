    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents currently struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they don't know *when* to check, leading to inefficient polling or premature failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days. SentinelStep dynamically adjusts polling intervals and manages context to prevent overflow, significantly improving the success rates of extended monitoring tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Custom Image Sensor Could Debut in 20th Anniversary iPhone</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning to debut LOFIC (Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor) camera sensor technology in its 2027 iPhone lineup. This next-generation imaging tech dramatically improves dynamic range, enabling iPhones to capture significantly more detail in both bright and dark areas of a single photo. While other manufacturers like Honor and Xiaomi are expected to adopt LOFIC earlier in 2026, Apple's custom version could be integrated into a radically redesigned 20th-anniversary iPhone model.</h2>
