    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in analyzing vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low diagnosis rates and prolonged suffering for rare disease patients. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline these complex sensemaking tasks. This AI tool aims to improve rare disease diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently aggregating crucial gene and variant information, ultimately reducing diagnosis time.</h2>
