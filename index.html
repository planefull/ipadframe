    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is challenging and time-consuming, with many cases remaining unsolved due to the vast amount of data and complex analysis required. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to explore designing a generative AI assistant to support genetic professionals in this process. This AI tool aims to enhance workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing extensive gene and variant information, thereby improving diagnostic yield and patient outcomes.</h2>
