    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, which require temporal understanding, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement beyond single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen with a Planner-Critic architecture that enables structured, iterative, and tool-based reasoning. This system, featuring specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components, enhances performance on benchmarks by augmenting base models with critical thinking and domain-specific tools, offering explainable, extensible, and scalable multimodal insights.</h2>
