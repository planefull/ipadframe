    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases, as interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data is time-consuming and often yields no initial diagnosis. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute collaboratively studied and designed a generative AI assistant. This AI tool aims to streamline data synthesis, flag cases for reanalysis with new scientific findings, and aggregate crucial genetic information, ultimately boosting diagnostic success and reducing diagnosis time for rare conditions.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2025 Product Roadmap: What's Still Coming</h1>
    <h2>Despite its major annual events being complete, Apple is expected to launch several new products before the end of 2025. These anticipated refreshes include an Apple TV with an A17 Pro chip, an M5 iPad Pro, an M5-powered Vision Pro, and an updated HomePod mini with an S10 chip. Other rumored releases include an AirTag 2 with improved tracking and potentially a lower-cost M5 MacBook Pro, with announcements likely made via press releases rather than a dedicated event.</h2>
