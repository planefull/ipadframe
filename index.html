    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The "Paraphrase Project," discussed on the Microsoft Research Podcast, revealed a "zero day" vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative cross-sector team quickly developed and implemented more robust protein screening solutions, effectively patching this vulnerability and strengthening global biosecurity. This pioneering effort also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive research data in scientific publications, highlighting the critical, ongoing need for proactive defenses against the dual-use risks of AI in biology.</h2>

    <h1>Facebook's New Collage Feature May Use Your Images for AI Training</h1>
    <h2>Meta is introducing a new opt-in AI-based collage and photo editing tool to Facebook, which scans your camera roll, uploads photos to the cloud, and suggests "fun collages and edits." This feature works behind the scenes to create private suggestions like themed recaps or AI restyling, which appear in Stories and Feed for users in the U.S. and Canada. However, if users share these AI-created suggestions, their images will be used for AI training, prompting a recommendation to restrict Facebook's camera roll access for privacy-conscious individuals.</h2>
