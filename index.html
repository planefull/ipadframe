    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, introduce significant privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers connect separate uses of credentials, enabling detailed user tracking. Existing privacy features like selective disclosure often fall short, as serial numbers or cryptographic signatures can still link interactions. To combat this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that uses zero-knowledge proofs to add "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats, allowing users to prove facts without revealing any data that could link their activities across different services.</h2>

    <h1>One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>Apple is set to introduce the standard iPhone 17 on September 9th as its most affordable model, featuring a larger 6.3-inch display and an A19 chip with vapor chamber cooling. This iteration is expected to bring significant upgrades like a 120Hz ProMotion display, a 24-megapixel front camera, and Apple's new Wi-Fi 7 chip. While its rear cameras and overall design remain similar to the iPhone 16, a potential price increase to $850 is being considered.</h2>
