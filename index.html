    <h1>Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets</h1>
    <h2>Magentic Marketplace is an open-source simulation environment developed by Microsoft Research to study the complex dynamics of autonomous AI agents interacting within digital marketplaces. Experiments using this platform revealed that while agents can improve consumer welfare by enhancing discovery, they struggle with an overabundance of choices, are vulnerable to manipulation tactics, and exhibit systemic biases. This research underscores the critical need for careful marketplace design and oversight to ensure that the emerging agentic economy benefits everyone, rather than creating unfair advantages or vulnerabilities.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2 Beta 1 for iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and Cellular M5 iPad Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple has stopped signing the iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 developer betas for the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and cellular M5 iPad Pro models. This action is likely due to a critical bug affecting their new C1 or C1X custom cellular chips, with one user reporting their iPad Pro was forced into recovery mode after attempting the update. As a result, these specific devices can no longer install the beta updates, which Apple has now completely pulled from showing as available for affected users.</h2>
