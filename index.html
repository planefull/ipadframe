    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose privacy risks due to "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be associated with an individual to build comprehensive user profiles. To combat this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent allows users to prove specific facts about their credentials and selectively disclose information without revealing unnecessary data or linking their various digital interactions, and it works without requiring updates to existing issuer systems.</h2>

    <h1>Refurbished Apple Pencil Pro Now Available in U.S. at a Discount</h1>
    <h2>The Apple Pencil Pro is now available for the first time in Apple's online refurbished stores in the U.S. and Canada since its launch in May 2024. In the U.S., it is priced at $109, a 15% discount from the brand new cost of $129. However, with Amazon currently selling a new Apple Pencil Pro for just $110.87, the refurbished option offers minimal savings despite Apple's assurance of like-new condition and thorough testing for its refurbished products.</h2>
