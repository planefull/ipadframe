    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals struggle to diagnose rare diseases from whole genome sequencing data due to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulties prioritizing reanalysis, leading to low diagnostic rates. To address these challenges, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed and studied a generative AI assistant designed to streamline genetic data analysis. This AI tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, fostering a collaborative human-AI approach.</h2>
