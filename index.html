    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose privacy risks due to "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be associated with an individual, leading to tracking. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common digital identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to verify specific facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or connecting separate interactions, and is designed for efficiency on mobile devices without requiring system updates from credential issuers.</h2>

    <h1>Apple and Samsung Push Back Against Xiaomi's Bold India Ads</h1>
    <h2>Apple and Samsung have reportedly issued cease-and-desist notices to Xiaomi in India, threatening legal action over an ad campaign. Xiaomi's ads directly compare and disparage rivals' devices, such as the iPhone 16 Pro Max's camera, by questioning their quality and touting Xiaomi's own specifications and lower prices. This legal pushback underscores the fierce competition in India's rapidly growing smartphone market, with Apple and Samsung keen to defend their reputation and market share.</h2>
