    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, which often leads to information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulties in reanalyzing unsolved cases. To address these issues, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute developed a study focusing on integrating a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by synthesizing biomedical data, flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings, and aggregating literature, ultimately increasing diagnostic rates and improving patient quality of life.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Provides Fix for iMessage Activation Bug in iOS 26</h1>
    <h2>Apple has provided troubleshooting steps for iPhone owners unable to activate iMessage with a phone number in iOS 26. This issue arises when an inactive SIM or eSIM with the same phone number as an active SIM is present, leading to iMessages being sent as green bubbles or via email. To fix it, users must remove the inactive SIM (either physically or by deleting the eSIM) and then reactivate iMessage with their phone number.</h2>
