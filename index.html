    <h1>Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure </h1>
    <h2>AI infrastructure is bottlenecked by a "networking wall" due to the limitations of current copper (short-range, efficient) and optical (long-range, power-hungry, unreliable) communication links, which rely on a few high-speed channels. Microsoft Research developed MOSAIC, a novel optical link technology that overcomes this trade-off by using a "wide-and-slow" architecture with hundreds of parallel low-speed channels powered by microLEDs. This innovation provides copper-like power efficiency and reliability over long distances (up to 50 meters), promising significant power savings, reduced failure rates, and the ability to enable more scalable and disaggregated AI network and compute architectures.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Extends Free Access to Satellite Features Across iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple has extended free access to its suite of satellite features for existing iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users for an additional year. This means devices activated in supported countries will continue to use these features for free until at least mid-September 2026. The services, which include Emergency SOS, Messages, Find My, and Roadside Assistance via satellite, function in areas without Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity.</h2>
