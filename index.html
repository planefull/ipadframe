    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project explores the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, revealing that AI tools can reformulate toxic proteins to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, creating a "zero-day" vulnerability. A cross-sector team conducted a cybersecurity-style red-teaming effort, successfully developing more robust protein screening systems and sharing these "patches" globally through the International Gene Synthesis Consortium. This project also pioneered a "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for sensitive research, demonstrating a new model for balancing open science with the need to mitigate catastrophic biological risks in the age of advanced AI.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</h1>
    <h2>Apple appears poised to release an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, with its website indicating availability on October 22, the same day the new M5 Vision Pro launches. This accessory enables a USB-C connection between the Vision Pro and a Mac for app development and diagnostics, with the current version limited to USB 2.0 speeds. While specifics like new features, pricing, or compatibility with the original Vision Pro are unknown, an upgrade is expected to coincide with the new hardware release.</h2>
