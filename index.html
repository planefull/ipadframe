    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently determine when to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for tasks lasting hours or days, making them proactive and resource-efficient for real-world monitoring applications.</h2>

    <h1>Waiting for New Macs? Apple Just Shared Bad News</h1>
    <h2>Apple has strongly indicated that it will not release any additional new Mac models for the remainder of 2025. CFO Kevan Parekh hinted at this during an earnings call, noting that Mac revenue would face a "difficult compare" due to fewer new launches this quarter than in the year-ago quarter. Consequently, several anticipated updates, such as MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro/Max chips, Mac mini, and iMacs, are now expected to launch in 2026.</h2>
