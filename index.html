    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, despite their convenience, pose significant privacy risks due to "linkability," which allows various credential uses to be tracked and associated with a specific person. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a new cryptographic library that introduces "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose necessary information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring updates from credential issuers.</h2>
