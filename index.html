    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research clarified its paper, "Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI," addressing misinterpretations that it predicted job elimination. The study actually aimed to identify occupations where AI chatbots could be useful tools, finding them most applicable to knowledge work, communication, writing, and information gathering tasks. The researchers explicitly state that their findings do not suggest jobs will be replaced by AI, emphasizing that a job encompasses more than just individual tasks and acknowledging methodological limitations.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h1>
    <h2>According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is reportedly considering releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air. Similar to the iPhone 4 bumper, this case would cover only the device's edges, offering protection while preserving the iPhone 17 Air's expected ultra-thin design. Separately, Apple is also rumored to be planning an iPhone 17 Air battery case for extended battery life.</h2>
