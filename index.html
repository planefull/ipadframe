    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex reasoning over long-form videos and large image collections, which require temporal understanding, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement beyond single-pass inference. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent utilizing a Planner–Critic architecture built on AutoGen, available on GitHub and Azure AI Foundry Labs. MMCTAgent employs specialized agents (ImageAgent and VideoAgent) with tool-based reasoning and a self-evaluation loop, significantly enhancing performance on benchmarks and providing explainable, scalable insights for diverse visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Another Designer Leaves Apple</h1>
    <h2>Abidur Chowdhury, a rising star designer known for introducing the iPhone Air, has left Apple to join an AI startup, reportedly making waves internally. His departure is unrelated to the iPhone Air's sales and adds to a trend of high-profile designers leaving Apple since Jony Ive's exit in 2019. Consequently, with former operations chief Jeff Williams' recent retirement, Apple's design team will now report directly to CEO Tim Cook.</h2>
