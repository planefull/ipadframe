    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but pose significant privacy risks through "linkability," where separate uses of credentials can be tracked to build user profiles. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to selectively disclose information and prevent separate digital interactions from being linked, all without requiring credential-issuing organizations to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple has appealed a recent court order that bans it from collecting fees on purchases made through external links within App Store apps, arguing the mandate is unconstitutional and improperly expands the original injunction from its lawsuit with Epic Games. This no-fee ruling came after Apple initially charged 12-27% for such purchases, leading Epic to successfully argue that Apple was in "willful violation" of the initial court directive. Apple asserts it should be compensated for its intellectual property and that the new injunction is overly broad, affecting all developers when it should be tailored only to Epic's specific case.</h2>
