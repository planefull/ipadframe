    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI-powered protein design tools could reformulate toxic protein sequences to bypass existing biosecurity screening systems, an issue described as the "first zero day" in AI biosecurity. In response, a cross-sector team developed and globally shared more robust protein screening systems and established a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy to responsibly manage access to sensitive research data. This initiative highlights the urgent need for ongoing vigilance and collaborative, cybersecurity-style approaches to mitigate the dual-use risks of rapidly advancing AI in biotechnology.</h2>
