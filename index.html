    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project, led by Microsoft, uncovered a critical vulnerability where AI tools could "paraphrase" toxic protein sequences, enabling them to evade existing biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. A cross-sector team then developed "red-teaming" approaches and implemented more robust protein screening systems, which were subsequently shared with global synthesis companies to address this "zero-day" threat. This effort also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsibly sharing sensitive research details, highlighting the continuous need for vigilance and new policies to manage dual-use risks posed by rapidly advancing AI.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Home Hub Could Cost $350</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly launching a new home hub with a 7-inch display and an indoor security camera in 2026, followed by a tabletop robot featuring a 9-inch motorized screen in 2027. The home hub, which was delayed for an updated Siri, will offer smart home control, app support, FaceTime, and person recognition, with an estimated price around $350. These new smart home devices will be manufactured in Vietnam with BYD, reflecting Apple's ongoing strategy to diversify its supply chain.</h2>
