    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, struggled to provide accurate and efficient technical answers due to its vast, complex product documentation and diverse data formats. To address this, Signify partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to integrate PIKE-RAG technology into its knowledge management system, built on Microsoft Azure. This collaboration resulted in a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling the system to understand multimodal content, rely on original documents, and perform multi-hop reasoning for complex inquiries, demonstrating PIKE-RAG's strong capabilities for industrial knowledge management.</h2>
