    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The article discusses the "Paraphrase Project," a collaborative effort that exposed a critical vulnerability in biosecurity: AI tools can redesign toxic proteins to evade existing screening systems. Researchers used open-source AI to "paraphrase" known toxic protein sequences, successfully bypassing current safeguards in DNA synthesis companies like Twist Bioscience. This discovery led to a "zero-day" cybersecurity-style response, resulting in the development and global implementation of more robust, AI-resilient screening systems and a novel approach to responsible data sharing for sensitive dual-use research.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Foldable iPhone Rumored to Use Titanium and Aluminum Frame</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone, anticipated for the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026, is rumored to feature a frame made from a mix of titanium and aluminum, according to analyst Jeff Pu. This material choice aligns with Apple's expanded use of titanium for durability, particularly crucial for the device's rumored ultra-thin design (as thin as 4.5mm when opened). While another analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, previously suggested titanium and stainless steel with Liquidmetal for hinges, both reports emphasize robust materials to prevent bending issues in the foldable design.</h2>
