    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price changes because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to monitor conditions for extended periods without getting sidetracked. Integrated into Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>New Version of Siri to 'Lean' on Google Gemini</h1>
    <h2>According to Mark Gurman's "Power On" newsletter, Apple plans to roll out a revamped Siri around March next year, accompanied by new smart home devices, an Apple TV, and a HomePod mini. This new Siri will "lean" on Google's Gemini for AI-powered web search, with Apple paying Google for a custom, privately run Gemini model to power its features. However, Gurman cautioned about potential user acceptance and brand challenges, while Apple Intelligence's launch in China continues to face regulatory issues.</h2>
