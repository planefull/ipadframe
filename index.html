    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to "wait" effectively, either exhausting their context window or giving up too soon. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI system that enables agents to perform these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling frequency and managing context to prevent overflow. This approach significantly improves the reliability of agents for tasks lasting hours or days, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
