    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price drops, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To solve this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently complete these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow that dynamically adjusts polling frequency and manages context to prevent overflow. Implemented in Magentic-UI, SentinelStep significantly improves agent reliability on longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more proactive, persistent, and resource-efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>8 Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 18 Pro</h1>
    <h2>Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models are anticipated for a September 2026 release as part of a new two-phase rollout, expected to largely retain the iPhone 17 Pro's design but with a potentially smaller Dynamic Island. Significant upgrades include the A20 Pro chip with advanced packaging for enhanced AI, Apple's C2 modem offering faster speeds and mmWave 5G, and a new Samsung-made three-layer stacked image sensor. Additionally, the Pro models are rumored to feature a variable aperture main camera for greater control over photography and support full 5G satellite internet connectivity.</h2>
