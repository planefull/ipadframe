    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leading LED lighting company, struggled to provide accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to vast product data, complex technical documentation, and multimodal information. To address this, they partnered with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology in their Azure-based knowledge management system. This integration led to a 12% improvement in answer accuracy by enabling multimodal document parsing, direct use of original documents, and dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex questions, showcasing its strong generalization capabilities for industrial knowledge management.</h2>
