    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, present significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where separate uses of digital credentials can be connected to create detailed user profiles. To combat this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using zero-knowledge SNARKs, allowing users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or linking separate interactions, and it integrates without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h1>
    <h2>Apple's upcoming standard iPhone 17, its most affordable new model, is expected to feature a larger 6.3-inch display with slimmer bezels and potentially 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates for the first time. This model will be powered by an A19 chip, incorporate vapor chamber cooling, and include Apple's new custom Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth chip, alongside an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera. While not as dramatically redesigned as the Air or Pro variants, it will also offer new color options and is slated for a September launch.</h2>
