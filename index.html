    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents often fail at long-running monitoring tasks, like watching for email responses or price drops, because they lack the ability to know *when* to check, leading to inefficiency or failure. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, allowing them to monitor conditions for hours or days. Integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of long-duration tasks by efficiently managing polling frequency and preventing context overflow, laying the groundwork for more patient and proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>If You Thought Ads in Apple Maps Was Bad, Samsung is Putting Ads on $1,900+ Refrigerators</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is rolling out a software update to its "Family Hub" smart refrigerators this week, introducing advertisements on their integrated displays starting November 3. These ads, initially for Samsung products and appearing by default on units costing up to $3,499, will show when the screen is idle, alongside other widgets like weather and calendar. Many customers are surprised and concerned, as they purchased these expensive appliances years ago without expectation of advertisements, although an opt-out option exists which disables all widget features.</h2>
