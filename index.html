    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while offering convenience, pose significant privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tracked and associated with a specific person. To address this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to widely used identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent employs zero-knowledge proofs and a two-stage process to enable users to selectively disclose information without revealing underlying data or linking their interactions, all without requiring credential issuers to update their existing systems.</h2>

    <h1>AirPods Pro 3 Coming Soon With Smaller Case and Capacitive Button</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming AirPods Pro 3 are expected to feature a slightly smaller charging case and replace the physical rear pairing button with a new capacitive button on the front. This new capacitive button, similar to the AirPods 4, will streamline the case design and potentially offer additional functionalities like playback controls. According to leaker Majin Bu and corroborated by other reports, the AirPods Pro 3 are anticipated to launch imminently, likely at Apple's September event this year.</h2>
