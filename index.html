    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, create privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate uses of credentials to be tracked and profiled. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information and prove facts without revealing any data that could link their separate digital interactions, effectively protecting their privacy without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
