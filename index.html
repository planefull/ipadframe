    <h1>RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents</h1>
    <h2>Code agents, while streamlining software development, introduce significant safety and security risks that existing evaluation methods often fail to detect due to their inability to assess code execution behaviors. To address this, researchers developed RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed to evaluate the safety of LLM-based code agents. RedCodeAgent combines a memory module, a tailored toolbox including code substitution, and simulated execution environments to successfully uncover vulnerabilities across diverse code agents, programming languages, and malware types, outperforming traditional jailbreak methods and discovering previously unknown security flaws.</h2>

    <h1>watchOS 26.2 Updates Sleep Score Ranges</h1>
    <h2>watchOS 26.2 updates the Apple Watch's Sleep Score feature, adjusting point ranges and labels to better match how users feel after a night's sleep. The categories have been revised, for example, "Very Low" is now 0-40 (previously 0-29), and "Excellent" has been renamed "Very High." While these changes aim for more accurate representation, the article notes that users might still receive a "High" score after five or six hours of restless sleep, despite Sleep Score evaluating duration, bedtime, and interruptions.</h2>
