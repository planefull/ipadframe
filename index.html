    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like tracking emails or price drops because they lack efficient waiting mechanisms, either polling excessively or giving up too soon. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a new mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for extended periods by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow. Implemented in their Magentic-UI prototype and now open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly boosts agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the foundation for proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Microsoft's Clippy Returns as Easter Egg in 'Humanist AI' Copilot Update</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft's latest Copilot update aims to make its AI assistant more friendly and human-centered, introducing "Mico," an animated orb designed as a cute and approachable visual companion for its voice mode. Mico listens, reacts, and changes colors based on user interactions, launching alongside other new features like Real Talk mode and a group chat system. Notably, repeatedly tapping Mico can briefly resurrect Clippy, the polarizing animated paperclip assistant from Office 97, indicating a return to character-driven AI.</h2>
