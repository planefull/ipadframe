    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities offer convenience but create privacy risks through "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow separate credential uses to be tracked and profiled. To counter this, Microsoft Research has released Crescent, a cryptographic library designed to add "unlinkability" to common identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this privacy protection using zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to prove specific facts about their credentials without revealing unnecessary information or allowing different interactions to be linked, all without requiring changes to existing credential issuance systems.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Says App Store Changes Go Too Far in New Epic Games Appeal Filing</h1>
    <h2>Apple is appealing a recent court order that prohibits it from collecting fees for purchases made through external links in App Store apps, arguing the mandate is unconstitutional and strips them of compensation for their intellectual property. This specific injunction arose from the ongoing Epic Games lawsuit, where Apple initially charged fees for external links as permitted by an earlier order, but Epic successfully argued these fees were unjustified, leading to a stricter "no-fee" ruling. Apple contends the new injunction improperly expands the original order, violates its First Amendment rights by dictating messaging, and is too broad as it applies to all developers rather than being tailored solely to the plaintiff, Epic Games.</h2>
