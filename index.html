    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to wait and check periodically without exhausting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research has introduced SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to perform these tasks by dynamically adjusting polling intervals and managing context to prevent overflow. Implemented in Magentic-UI and open-sourced, SentinelStep significantly improves the reliability of agents over extended durations, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>If You Thought Ads in Apple Maps Was Bad, Samsung is Putting Ads on $1,900+ Refrigerators</h1>
    <h2>Samsung is rolling out advertisements to its "Family Hub" smart refrigerators, appearing on the integrated displays of these high-priced appliances which start at $1,899. A software update, starting November 3rd, will introduce these ads by default on idle screens, initially for Samsung products, with third-party ads expected later. This move has surprised many existing customers who purchased the refrigerators without any expectation of future advertising, despite the option to opt out (which disables other widget features).</h2>
