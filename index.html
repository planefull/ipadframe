    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, introduce privacy risks through "linkability," allowing separate uses of credentials to be tied to individuals and used for tracking. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds unlinkability to common digital identity formats, including JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent achieves this by using efficient zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to selectively disclose information and prove facts about their credentials without revealing underlying data or allowing their separate interactions to be linked, all without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>
