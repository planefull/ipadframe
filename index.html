    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, though convenient, create significant privacy risks due to "linkability," where hidden identifiers allow various digital activities to be associated with a single user. To address this, Microsoft Research has developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to popular identity formats like JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Crescent utilizes efficient zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to selectively disclose information without revealing any identifiers that could link their separate digital interactions, all without requiring credential issuers to update their systems.</h2>
