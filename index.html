    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study on integrating generative AI to help genetic professionals diagnose rare diseases more efficiently. Diagnosing these diseases is currently complex and time-consuming due to information overload, challenges in collaborative sharing, and difficulty prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. The study led to the design of an AI assistant prototype that flags cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizes crucial gene and variant data from scientific literature, aiming to increase diagnostic yield and shorten diagnosis times.</h2>
