    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to address the challenges genetic professionals face in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing. They identified critical issues like information overload, inefficient collaboration, and difficulty prioritizing case reanalysis. The study proposes a generative AI assistant designed to flag cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and efficiently synthesize vast amounts of gene and variant data, aiming to streamline diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.</h2>

    <h1>iPad Mini 8 Rumors: Everything We Know So Far</h1>
    <h2>Apple's eighth-generation iPad mini is expected to launch next year, possibly in the first half, with its main upgrade being the A19 Pro chip. This chip, revealed through Apple's own code, is anticipated to be a binned version also used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro. Aside from this processor boost and refreshed color options, no other significant new features are likely, with more substantial upgrades like OLED displays projected for future models in 2026 or 2027.</h2>
