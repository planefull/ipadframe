    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Current LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks like waiting for an email or price drop, failing because they don't know *when* to check, leading to resource waste or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that enables agents to patiently monitor conditions for hours or days using dynamic polling and careful context management. This approach, implemented in Magentic-UI, significantly improves agent reliability for longer tasks, laying the groundwork for more proactive and efficient AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</h1>
    <h2>In 2012, Apple retail employee Sam Sung went viral due to his name being identical to Apple's competitor, Samsung, causing him significant stress and leading Apple to pull him from the store floor. Feeling immense pressure and fearing for his job, Sung eventually left Apple in 2013 and later auctioned off his memorabilia for charity. Years after the incident, he ultimately changed his last name to Struan to escape being known as an "internet joke" and avoid the unwanted attention.</h2>
