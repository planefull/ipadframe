    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex data from whole genome sequencing, resulting in low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research collaborated with Drexel University and the Broad Institute to study these obstacles and co-design a generative AI assistant. This AI tool is envisioned to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, aiming to improve diagnostic yield and reduce the time to diagnosis for patients.</h2>
