    <h1>Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale</h1>
    <h2>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling significant advances in agentic AI by facilitating horizontal integration of diverse tools, but this progress introduces "tool-space interference." This interference, observed in a survey of MCP servers, includes challenges like high tool counts, excessively long responses, complex parameter schemas, tool name collisions, and poor error reporting, all of which can reduce overall agent effectiveness. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends implementing formal namespaces, enhancing client-provided resource support, encouraging transparent server documentation, and developing client-side optimizations for a more interoperable and scalable "society of agents."</h2>

    <h1>Apple Store Near Sydney Permanently Closing Next Month</h1>
    <h2>Apple is permanently closing its store at Westfield Hornsby in Australia on October 4, opting not to renew its lease. All affected retail employees will be offered opportunities to work at Apple's nearby Chatswood Chase store, which is set to reopen in October after extensive renovations. The Chatswood Chase store, which will be completely redesigned with new features like an Apple Pickup station, will consolidate operations previously handled by the Hornsby location.</h2>
