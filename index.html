    <h1>Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems</h1>
    <h2>Digital identities, while convenient, pose privacy risks like "linkability," which allows separate uses of credentials to be tracked and user profiles built. To address this, Microsoft Research developed Crescent, a cryptographic library that adds "unlinkability" to common identity formats such as JSON Web Tokens and mobile driver's licenses. Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, Crescent enables users to selectively disclose necessary information without revealing linking identifiers, functioning efficiently on mobile devices and without requiring issuers to update their systems.</h2>

    <h1>iPhone 17 Air is Launching Soon, Here Are All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be the thinnest iPhone ever at 5.5mm, featuring a significant design update, a lightweight build, and a 6.6-inch 120Hz LTPO OLED display. It will be powered by an A19 chip with 12GB RAM, include an upgraded 48-megapixel main camera, and support Wi-Fi 7 and 25W wireless charging. However, its extreme thinness results in a smaller 2,800mAh battery and a single rear camera, with an anticipated launch price around $899.</h2>
