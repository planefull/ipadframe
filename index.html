    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project investigated the dual-use nature of AI in protein design, revealing that open-source tools could redesign toxic proteins to evade existing biosecurity screening systems, a vulnerability dubbed a "zero-day" in AI and biosecurity. Through a collaborative, cybersecurity-style "red-teaming" approach, the team developed and shared "patches" to strengthen these screening tools, making them more resilient against AI-generated threats. The project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" strategy for responsible sharing of sensitive research data, emphasizing the critical need for continuous adaptation and international cooperation to manage evolving AI-enabled biosecurity risks.</h2>
