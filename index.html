    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to efficiently wait and know *when* to check for updates, leading to wasted resources or missed events. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow with dynamic polling and careful context management, enabling them to monitor conditions for hours or days. This approach, implemented in the open-source Magentic-UI system, significantly improves agent reliability for extended tasks, making them more patient and proactive for real-world applications.</h2>

    <h1>iOS 26.1 Beta Liquid Glass Battery Drain Test: Tinted vs Clear Mode</h1>
    <h2>In the iOS 26.1 beta, an author tested whether the new "Tinted" Liquid Glass option and other transparency/motion settings impact iPhone battery life. Using an iPhone 17 Pro Max, the author conducted a controlled 2.5-hour test across four different visual configurations of Liquid Glass and related accessibility settings. The results showed no meaningful or consistent difference in battery drain, concluding that these settings won't significantly improve battery life and should be chosen based on visual preference.</h2>
