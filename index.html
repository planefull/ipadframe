    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with real-world reasoning over long-form video and large image datasets, requiring capabilities beyond simple object recognition and short-clip analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, a Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent built on AutoGen, which employs a Planner–Critic architecture for structured and iterative reasoning. This system, available on GitHub and Azure AI Foundry Labs, uses modality-specific agents and specialized tools to analyze complex queries, significantly improving performance on multimodal benchmarks by enabling planning, reflection, and tool-based evidence validation.</h2>

    <h1>iPad Air 2026: All the Rumors</h1>
    <h2>The iPad Air is expected to receive an internal-focused update around March or April 2026, alongside other iPad models. This refresh will primarily bring performance upgrades, including the M4 chip, an N1 networking chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and potentially faster charging and Apple's C1X modem. However, the design, display technology (remaining LED without ProMotion), camera options, and starting price are anticipated to stay the same.</h2>
