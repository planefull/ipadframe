    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks, such as tracking emails or price changes, because they lack the ability to intelligently manage polling frequency and context over time. To address this, Microsoft Research developed SentinelStep, a mechanism that wraps agents in a workflow featuring dynamic polling adjustments and careful context management. This innovation allows agents to efficiently monitor conditions for hours or days, significantly improving reliability for extended tasks and paving the way for more patient, proactive AI assistants.</h2>

    <h1>iFixit Tears Down M5 MacBook Pro</h1>
    <h2>iFixit conducted a teardown of Apple's new M5 MacBook Pro, finding only minor changes from the previous model beyond the new chip and faster SSD. The device largely maintains its low repairability, with components like the battery remaining difficult to replace as it requires removing nearly every other part, and still uses proprietary P5 screws. Despite a small improvement in trackpad access for some battery pull tabs and a slightly larger battery capacity, iFixit ultimately gave the M5 MacBook Pro a low repairability score of 4 out of 10.</h2>
