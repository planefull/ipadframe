    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases through whole genome sequencing due to information overload, complex data analysis, and time-consuming reanalysis processes. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, developed and studied a generative AI assistant designed to enhance their sensemaking tasks. This AI tool aims to streamline diagnosis by flagging cases for reanalysis and efficiently synthesizing vast amounts of gene and variant data, ultimately improving diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis.</h2>
