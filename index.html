    <h1>Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research recently studied how generative AI, like Bing Copilot, could be useful in various occupations, finding it most applicable to knowledge work and communication tasks such as writing and information gathering. The authors clarify that their research identifies where AI can assist or perform subtasks, explicitly stating it does not conclude that jobs will be eliminated. They emphasize that the study highlights AI as a tool to improve workflows and complement human strengths, acknowledging limitations in predicting broader job displacement.</h2>
