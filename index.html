    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with complex, real-world reasoning over long-form video and large image collections due to limitations in temporal reasoning and iterative refinement. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner–Critic architecture. This agent iteratively uses specialized tools for video (e.g., ingestion, context retrieval) and image analysis (e.g., object detection, OCR), significantly enhancing base model performance by enabling structured reasoning, self-evaluation, and extensibility across vast visual data.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Mac Plans</h1>
    <h2>Apple's Mac lineup is slated for a major refresh in 2026, primarily introducing M5 chips across various models, with a possibility of the first M6 chips appearing late in the year. Updates are expected for the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and iMac, alongside the debut of a new low-cost MacBook featuring an A18 Pro chip. Additionally, 2026 could see new Mac displays and a highly anticipated OLED MacBook Pro with a touchscreen, M6 chips, and 5G connectivity.</h2>
