    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Modern multimodal AI models struggle with tasks involving long-form videos and large image libraries, lacking the temporal reasoning and iterative refinement needed for complex real-world visual analysis. To address this, Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent), an AutoGen-based system featuring a Planner-Critic architecture for structured reasoning over extensive visual data. This agent employs modality-specific tools and an iterative feedback loop to enhance accuracy, explainability, and extensibility, significantly improving performance on challenging multimodal question-answering tasks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2026 Mac Plans</h1>
    <h2>Apple has extensive plans for its Mac lineup in 2026, with most models slated to receive M5 chip updates and the potential for initial M6 chips by the end of the year. This includes refreshes for the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and iMac, along with the introduction of a new, low-cost 13-inch MacBook featuring an A18 Pro chip. Additionally, two new Mac displays are in development, and a redesigned OLED MacBook Pro with a touchscreen and M6 chip is possible by late 2026.</h2>
