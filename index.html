    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in diagnosing rare diseases due to the vast and complex whole genome sequencing data, information overload, and difficulties in prioritizing reanalysis of unsolved cases. To address this, Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, co-designed a generative AI assistant to streamline the complex "sensemaking" tasks inherent in genetic analysis. This AI-enhanced tool aims to improve diagnostic yield and reduce diagnosis time by efficiently flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information, fostering better expert-AI collaboration.</h2>
