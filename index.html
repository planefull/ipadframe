    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Paraphrase Project uncovered a critical "zero day" vulnerability where AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences, such as ricin, to evade existing biosecurity screening systems. A collaborative team then developed red-teaming approaches and implemented "patches," resulting in a more robust, AI-resilient protein screening system that was shared with global gene synthesis companies. This effort not only strengthened biosecurity defenses but also established a novel perpetual gatekeeping strategy for sensitive scientific data, highlighting the ongoing need for proactive measures to manage AI's dual-use risks.</h2>

    <h1>Apple Rumored to Launch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip Before M5 Pro and M5 Max Models</h1>
    <h2>Apple is reportedly planning a staggered release for its M5 MacBook Pro models, launching a base M5 chip version first. This entry-level MacBook Pro is said to be "nearing release," possibly in late 2025, and is being tested with an unreleased macOS version. Higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are then expected to follow in early 2026.</h2>
