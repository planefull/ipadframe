    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent (Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent) to overcome current AI limitations in reasoning over extensive, long-form visual data like videos and large image collections. Built on AutoGen, this framework employs a Planner–Critic architecture with specialized agents (ImageAgent, VideoAgent) to enable iterative, tool-based reasoning, evaluation, and refinement of answers. This design allows MMCTAgent to strategically analyze complex queries across diverse modalities, significantly improving performance and providing explainable insights compared to traditional one-shot inference models.</h2>

    <h1>Report: Low-Cost iPhone, iPad, MacBook Coming Early 2026</h1>
    <h2>According to a research report by Jeff Pu, Apple is planning to launch new entry-level iPhone, iPad, and an affordable MacBook models early next year. The most notable addition is a low-cost MacBook, expected to be priced between $699 and $899, featuring a 13-inch display and an A18 Pro chip from future iPhones, likely with some design compromises. Additionally, the iPhone 17e will receive an A19 chip and an upgraded camera, while the 12th-generation iPad will be updated with an A18 chip to support Apple Intelligence.</h2>
