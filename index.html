    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Genetic professionals face significant challenges in accurately interpreting vast whole genome sequencing data, leading to low initial diagnosis rates and time-consuming reanalysis for rare diseases. To address this, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, and the Broad Institute co-designed a generative AI assistant aimed at streamlining the complex sensemaking tasks in genetic analysis. This AI tool seeks to enhance diagnostic efficiency and shorten diagnosis times by flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings and synthesizing crucial gene and variant information.</h2>

    <h1>Apple's 2025 Product Roadmap: What's Still Coming</h1>
    <h2>Apple is planning to release several updated products by the end of 2025, despite its major WWDC and iPhone launch events already being concluded. These anticipated refreshes primarily focus on internal upgrades, including faster chips and improved connectivity, for devices like the Apple TV, iPad Pro, Vision Pro, HomePod mini, and AirTag 2. Specific enhancements include an A17 Pro chip for the Apple TV, an M5 chip for the iPad Pro and Vision Pro, an S10 chip for the HomePod mini, and a longer-range Ultra Wideband chip for the AirTag 2, with a new MacBook Pro also potentially arriving soon.</h2>
