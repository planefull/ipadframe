    <h1>Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act</h1>
    <h2>Modern LLM agents struggle with long-running monitoring tasks because they lack the ability to efficiently "wait" and dynamically poll for conditions without wasting resources or giving up. To address this, Microsoft Research introduces SentinelStep, a mechanism integrated into their Magentic-UI prototype that enables agents to perform these tasks by wrapping them in a workflow with dynamic polling intervals and careful context management. This approach significantly improves agent reliability for extended monitoring periods, laying the groundwork for more patient, proactive, and efficient AI assistants.</h2>
