    <h1>MMCTAgent: Enabling multimodal reasoning over large video and image collections</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research developed MMCTAgent, an open-source Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent, to address the challenges of multimodal AI struggling with long-form and large-scale visual data that requires complex temporal and cross-modal reasoning. Built on AutoGen, MMCTAgent utilizes a Planner–Critic architecture, with specialized ImageAgent and VideoAgent components, enabling iterative, tool-based reasoning, self-evaluation, and refinement of answers. This framework significantly enhances the performance of base LLMs by integrating perception tools and structured ingestion pipelines, providing more accurate, explainable, and scalable insights for complex queries over extensive video and image collections.</h2>
