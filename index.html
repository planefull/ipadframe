    <h1>Ideas: More AI-resilient biosecurity with the Paraphrase Project</h1>
    <h2>The Microsoft Research podcast episode focuses on the "Paraphrase Project," which discovered that AI tools could redesign toxic protein sequences in ways that evaded existing biosecurity screening systems, posing a "zero day" vulnerability. A collaborative cross-sector team developed new "patched" screening solutions to counter this, which were then shared with DNA synthesis companies worldwide to enhance biosecurity. The project also pioneered a novel "perpetual gatekeeping" approach for responsible sharing of sensitive scientific data, offering a crucial model for managing information hazards in other dual-use technologies.</h2>

    <h1>M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</h1>
    <h2>Apple plans to launch MacBook Air models with the new M5 chip in spring 2026, while M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models are expected earlier that year. These initial updates will focus solely on chip upgrades, though a major design refresh for the MacBook Pro, featuring thinner OLED touch screens, is slated for late 2026 or early 2027. Additionally, Apple is developing new Mac Studio and Mac mini models with M5 Pro/Max chips, alongside two new external displays, including a second-generation Studio Display.</h2>
