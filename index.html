    <h1>When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost</h1>
    <h2>Signify, a leader in LED lighting, faced significant challenges in providing accurate and efficient answers to professional users due to complex product data and diverse technical documentation. To address this, they collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia to implement PIKE-RAG technology into their Azure-based knowledge management system. This advanced RAG system improved answer accuracy by 12% by better understanding multimodal documents, using original data sources, and performing dynamic multi-hop reasoning for complex queries.</h2>
