    <h1>RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft Research has developed RenderFormer, a novel neural architecture that completely replaces traditional physics-based 3D rendering with a machine learning approach. This transformer-based model processes 3D scenes using triangle and ray bundle tokens to simulate complex lighting and material interactions, enabling full-featured rendering with global illumination without conventional graphics computations. RenderFormer marks a significant step towards a general-purpose neural rendering model, offering greater generalizability and potential for integration with broader AI systems.</h2>
