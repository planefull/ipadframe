    <h1>Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis</h1>
    <h2>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases through whole genome sequencing is challenging due to information overload, complex data synthesis, and the time-consuming nature of reanalyzing unsolved cases. Microsoft Research, in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute, conducted a study to design a generative AI-based assistant to support genetic professionals in these sensemaking tasks. This AI tool aims to streamline workflows by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data, ultimately enhancing diagnostic yield and improving patient outcomes.</h2>
